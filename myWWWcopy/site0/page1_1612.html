"The Nautilus has brought us to Vanikoro?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Yes, Professor," said the Captain.<br>
<br>
"And I can visit the celebrated islands where the Boussole and the<br>
Astrolabe struck?"<br>
<br>
"If you like, Professor."<br>
<br>
"When shall we be there?"<br>
<br>
"We are there now."<br>
<br>
Followed by Captain Nemo, I went up on to the platform, and greedily<br>
scanned the horizon.<br>
<br>
To the N.E. two volcanic islands emerged of unequal size, surrounded by<br>
a coral reef that measured forty miles in circumference.  We were close<br>
to Vanikoro, really the one to which Dumont d'Urville gave the name of<br>
Isle de la Recherche, and exactly facing the little harbour of Vanou,<br>
situated in 16째 4' S. lat., and 164째 32' E. long.  The earth<br>
seemed covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the<br>
interior, that were crowned by Mount Kapogo, 476 feet high.  The<br>
Nautilus, having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait,<br>
found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty<br>
fathoms deep.  Under the verdant shade of some mangroves I perceived<br>
some savages, who appeared greatly surprised at our approach.  In the<br>
long black body, moving between wind and water, did they not see some<br>
formidable cetacean that they regarded with suspicion?<br>
<br>
Just then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the wreck of La<br>
Perouse.<br>
<br>
"Only what everyone knows, Captain," I replied.<br>
<br>
"And could you tell me what everyone knows about it?" he inquired,<br>
ironically.<br>
<br>
"Easily."<br>
<br>
I related to him all that the last works of Dumont d'Urville had made<br>
known--works from which the following is a brief account.<br>
<br>
La Perouse, and his second, Captain de Langle, were sent by Louis XVI,<br>
in 1785, on a voyage of circumnavigation.  They embarked in the<br>
corvettes Boussole and the Astrolabe, neither of which were again heard<br>
of.  In 1791, the French Government, justly uneasy as to the fate of<br>
these two sloops, manned two large merchantmen, the Recherche and the<br>
Esperance, which left Brest the 28th of September under the command of<br>
Bruni d'Entrecasteaux.<br>
<br>
Two months after, they learned from Bowen, commander of the Albemarle,<br>
that the debris of shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coasts of<br>
New Georgia.  But D'Entrecasteaux, ignoring this communication--rather<br>
uncertain, besides--directed his course towards the Admiralty Islands,<br>
mentioned in a report of Captain Hunter's as being the place where La<br>
Perouse was wrecked.<br>
<br>
They sought in vain.  The Esperance and the Recherche passed before<br>
Vanikoro without stopping there, and, in fact, this voyage was most<br>
disastrous, as it cost D'Entrecasteaux his life, and those of two of<br>
his lieutenants, besides several of his crew.<br>
<br>
Captain Dillon, a shrewd old Pacific sailor, was the first to find<br>
unmistakable traces of the wrecks.  On the 15th of May, 1824, his<br>
vessel, the St. Patrick, passed close to Tikopia, one of the New<br>
Hebrides.  There a Lascar came alongside in a canoe, sold him the<br>
handle of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved<br>
on the hilt.  The Lascar pretended that six years before, during a stay<br>
at Vanikoro, he had seen two Europeans that belonged to some vessels<br>
that had run aground on the reefs some years ago.<br>
<br>
Dillon guessed that he meant La Perouse, whose disappearance had<br>
troubled the whole world.  He tried to get on to Vanikoro, where,<br>
according to the Lascar, he would find numerous debris of the wreck,<br>
but winds and tides prevented him.<br>
<br>
Dillon returned to Calcutta.  There he interested the Asiatic Society<br>
and the Indian Company in his discovery.  A vessel, to which was given<br>
the name of the Recherche, was put at his disposal, and he set out,<br>
23rd January, 1827, accompanied by a French agent.<br>
<br>
The Recherche, after touching at several points in the Pacific, cast<br>
anchor before Vanikoro, 7th July, 1827, in that same harbour of Vanou<br>
where the Nautilus was at this time.<br>
<br>
There it collected numerous relics of the wreck--iron utensils,<br>
anchors, pulley-strops, swivel-guns, an 18 lb. shot, fragments of<br>
astronomical instruments, a piece of crown work, and a bronze clock,<br>
bearing this inscription--"Bazin m'a fait," the mark of the foundry of<br>
the arsenal at Brest about 1785.  There could be no further doubt.<br>
<br>
Dillon, having made all inquiries, stayed in the unlucky place till<br>
October.  Then he quitted Vanikoro, and directed his course towards New<br>
Zealand; put into Calcutta, 7th April, 1828, and returned to France,<br>
where he was warmly welcomed by Charles X.<br>
<br>
But at the same time, without knowing Dillon's movements, Dumont<br>
d'Urville had already set out to find the scene of the wreck.  And they<br>
had learned from a whaler that some medals and a cross of St. Louis had<br>
been found in the hands of some savages of Louisiade and New Caledonia.<br>
Dumont d'Urville, commander of the Astrolabe, had then sailed, and two<br>
months after Dillon had left Vanikoro he put into Hobart Town.  There<br>
he learned the results of Dillon's inquiries, and found that a certain<br><a href="../site7/page6_8037.html">link1_text</a>
James Hobbs, second lieutenant of the Union of Calcutta, after landing<br>
on an island situated 8째 18' S. lat., and 156째 30' E. long.,<br>
had seen some iron bars and red stuffs used by the natives of these<br>
parts.  Dumont d'Urville, much perplexed, and not knowing how to credit<br>
the reports of low-class journals, decided to follow Dillon's track.<br>
<br>
On the 10th of February, 1828, the Astrolabe appeared off Tikopia, and<br>
took as guide and interpreter a deserter found on the island; made his<br>
way to Vanikoro, sighted it on the 12th inst., lay among the reefs<br>
until the 14th, and not until the 20th did he cast anchor within the<br>
barrier in the harbour of Vanou.<br>
<br>
On the 23rd, several officers went round the island and brought back<br>
some unimportant trifles.  The natives, adopting a system of denials<br>
and evasions, refused to take them to the unlucky place.  This<br>
ambiguous conduct led them to believe that the natives had ill-treated<br>
the castaways, and indeed they seemed to fear that Dumont d'Urville had<br>
come to avenge La Perouse and his unfortunate crew.<br>
<br>
However, on the 26th, appeased by some presents, and understanding that<br>
they had no reprisals to fear, they led M. Jacquireot to the scene of<br>
the wreck.<br>
<br>
There, in three or four fathoms of water, between the reefs of Pacou<br>
and Vanou, lay anchors, cannons, pigs of lead and iron, embedded in the<br>
limy concretions.  The large boat and the whaler belonging to the<br>
Astrolabe were sent to this place, and, not without some difficulty,<br>
their crews hauled up an anchor weighing 1,800 lbs., a brass gun, some<br>
pigs of iron, and two copper swivel-guns.<br>
<br>
Dumont d'Urville, questioning the natives, learned too that La Perouse,<br>
after losing both his vessels on the reefs of this island, had<br>
constructed a smaller boat, only to be lost a second time.  Where, no<br>
one knew.<br>
<br>
But the French Government, fearing that Dumont d'Urville was not<br>
acquainted with Dillon's movements, had sent the sloop Bayonnaise,<br>
commanded by Legoarant de Tromelin, to Vanikoro, which had been<br>
stationed on the west coast of America.  The Bayonnaise cast her anchor<br>
before Vanikoro some months after the departure of the Astrolabe, but<br>
found no new document; but stated that the savages had respected the<br>
monument to La Perouse.  That is the substance of what I told Captain<br>
Nemo.<br>
<b>
"So," he said, "no one knows now where the third vessel perished that<br>
was constructed by the castaways on the island of Vanikoro?"<br>
<br>
"No one knows."<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo said nothing, but signed to me to follow him into the<br>
large saloon.  The Nautilus sank several yards below the waves, and the<br>
panels were opened.<br>
<br>
I hastened to the aperture, and under the crustations of coral, covered<br>
with fungi, syphonules, alcyons, madrepores, through myriads of<br>
charming fish--girelles, glyphisidri, pompherides, diacopes, and<br>
holocentres--I recognised certain debris that the drags had not been<br>
able to tear up--iron stirrups, anchors, cannons, bullets, capstan<br>
fittings, the stem of a ship, all objects clearly proving the wreck of<br>
some vessel, and now carpeted with living flowers. While I was looking<br>
on this desolate scene, Captain Nemo said, in a sad voice:<br>
<br>
"Commander La Perouse set out 7th December, 1785, with his vessels La<br>
Boussole and the Astrolabe.  He first cast anchor at Botany Bay,<br>
visited the Friendly Isles, New Caledonia, then directed his course<br>
towards Santa Cruz, and put into Namouka, one of the Hapai group.  Then<br>
his vessels struck on the unknown reefs of Vanikoro.  The Boussole,<br>
which went first, ran aground on the southerly coast.  The Astrolabe<br>
went to its help, and ran aground too.  The first vessel was destroyed<br>
almost immediately.  The second, stranded under the wind, resisted some<br>
days.  The natives made the castaways welcome.  They installed<br>
themselves in the island, and constructed a smaller boat with the<br>
debris of the two large ones.  Some sailors stayed willingly at<br>
Vanikoro; the others, weak and ill, set out with La Perouse.  They<br>
directed their course towards the Solomon Islands, and there perished,<br>
with everything, on the westerly coast of the chief island of the<br>
group, between Capes Deception and Satisfaction."<br>
<br>
"How do you know that?"<br>
<br>
"By this, that I found on the spot where was the last wreck."<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo showed me a tin-plate box, stamped with the French arms,<br>
and corroded by the salt water.  He opened it, and I saw a bundle of<br>
papers, yellow but still readable.<br>
<br>
They were the instructions of the naval minister to Commander La<br>
Perouse, annotated in the margin in Louis XVI's handwriting.<br>
<br>
"Ah! it is a fine death for a sailor!" said Captain Nemo, at last.  "A<br>
coral tomb makes a quiet grave; and I trust that I and my comrades will<br>
find no other."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIX<br>
<br>
TORRES STRAITS<br>
<br>
During the night of the 27th or 28th of December, the Nautilus left the<br>
shores of Vanikoro with great speed.  Her course was south-westerly,<br>
and in three days she had gone over the 750 leagues that separated it<br>
from La Perouse's group and the south-east point of Papua.<br>
<br><a href="../site0/page5_1390.html">link2_text</a>
Early on the 1st of January, 1863, Conseil joined me on the platform.<br>
<br>
"Master, will you permit me to wish you a happy New Year?"<br>
<br>
"What!  Conseil; exactly as if I was at Paris in my study at the Jardin<br>
des Plantes?  Well, I accept your good wishes, and thank you for them.<br>
Only, I will ask you what you mean by a `Happy New Year' under our<br>
circumstances?  Do you mean the year that will bring us to the end of<br>
our imprisonment, or the year that sees us continue this strange<br>
voyage?"<br>
<br>
"Really, I do not know how to answer, master.  We are sure to see<br>
curious things, and for the last two months we have not had time for<br>
dullness.  The last marvel is always the most astonishing; and, if we<br>
continue this progression, I do not know how it will end.  It is my<br>
opinion that we shall never again see the like.  I think then, with no<br>
offence to master, that a happy year would be one in which we could see<br>
everything."<br>
<br>
On 2nd January we had made 11,340 miles, or 5,250 French leagues, since<br>
our starting-point in the Japan Seas.  Before the ship's head stretched<br>
the dangerous shores of the coral sea, on the north-east coast of<br>
Australia.  Our boat lay along some miles from the redoubtable bank on<br>
which Cook's vessel was lost, 10th June, 1770.  The boat in which Cook<br>
was struck on a rock, and, if it did not sink, it was owing to a piece<br>
of coral that was broken by the shock, and fixed itself in the broken<br>
keel.<br>
<br>
I had wished to visit the reef, 360 leagues long, against which the<br>
sea, always rough, broke with great violence, with a noise like<br>
thunder.  But just then the inclined planes drew the Nautilus down to a<br>
great depth, and I could see nothing of the high coral walls.  I had to<br>
content myself with the different specimens of fish brought up by the<br>
nets.  I remarked, among others, some germons, a species of mackerel as<br>
large as a tunny, with bluish sides, and striped with transverse bands,<br>
that disappear with the animal's life.<br>
<br>
These fish followed us in shoals, and furnished us with very delicate<br>
food. We took also a large number of gilt-heads, about one and a half<br>
inches long, tasting like dorys; and flying pyrapeds like submarine<br>
swallows, which, in dark nights, light alternately the air and water<br>
with their phosphorescent light. Among the molluscs and zoophytes, I<br>
found in the meshes of the net several species of alcyonarians, echini,<br>
hammers, spurs, dials, cerites, and hyalleae. The flora was represented<br>
by beautiful floating seaweeds, laminariae, and macrocystes,<br>
impregnated with the mucilage that transudes through their pores; and<br>
among which I gathered an admirable Nemastoma Geliniarois, that was<br>
classed among the natural curiosities of the museum.<br>
<br>
Two days after crossing the coral sea, 4th January, we sighted the<br>
Papuan coasts.  On this occasion, Captain Nemo informed me that his<br>
intention was to get into the Indian Ocean by the Strait of Torres.<br>
His communication ended there.<br>
<br>
The Torres Straits are nearly thirty-four leagues wide; but they are<br>
obstructed by an innumerable quantity of islands, islets, breakers, and<br>
rocks, that make its navigation almost impracticable; so that Captain<br>
Nemo took all needful precautions to cross them.  The Nautilus,<br>
floating betwixt wind and water, went at a moderate pace.  Her screw,<br>
like a cetacean's tail, beat the waves slowly.<br>
<br>
Profiting by this, I and my two companions went up on to the deserted<br>
platform.  Before us was the steersman's cage, and I expected that<br>
Captain Nemo was there directing the course of the Nautilus.  I had<br>
before me the excellent charts of the Straits of Torres, and I<br>
consulted them attentively.  Round the Nautilus the sea dashed<br>
furiously.  The course of the waves, that went from south-east to<br>
north-west at the rate of two and a half miles, broke on the coral that<br>
showed itself here and there.<br>
<br>
"This is a bad sea!" remarked Ned Land.<br>
<br>
"Detestable indeed, and one that does not suit a boat like the<br>
Nautilus."<br>
<br>
"The Captain must be very sure of his route, for I see there pieces of<br>
coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly."<br>
<br>
Indeed the situation was dangerous, but the Nautilus seemed to slide<br>
like magic off these rocks.  It did not follow the routes of the<br>
Astrolabe and the Zelee exactly, for they proved fatal to Dumont<br>
d'Urville. It bore more northwards, coasted the Islands of Murray, and<br>
came back to the south-west towards Cumberland Passage.  I thought it<br>
was going to pass it by, when, going back to north-west, it went<br>
through a large quantity of islands and islets little known, towards<br>
the Island Sound and Canal Mauvais.<br>
<br>
I wondered if Captain Nemo, foolishly imprudent, would steer his vessel<br>
into that pass where Dumont d'Urville's to corvettes touched; when,<br>
swerving again, and cutting straight through to the west, he steered<br>
for the Island of Gilboa.<br>
<br>
It was then three in the afternoon.  The tide began to recede, being<br>
quite full.  The Nautilus approached the island, that I still saw, with<br>
its remarkable border of screw-pines. He stood off it at about two<br>
miles distant.  Suddenly a shock overthrew me.  The Nautilus just<br>
touched a rock, and stayed immovable, laying lightly to port side.<br>
<br>
When I rose, I perceived Captain Nemo and his lieutenant on the<br>
platform.  They were examining the situation of the vessel, and<br>
exchanging words in their incomprehensible dialect.<br>
<br>
She was situated thus:  Two miles, on the starboard side, appeared<br>
Gilboa, stretching from north to west like an immense arm.  Towards the<br><a href="../site5/page1_5432.html">link3_text</a>
south and east some coral showed itself, left by the ebb.  We had run<br>
aground, and in one of those seas where the tides are middling--a sorry<br>
matter for the floating of the Nautilus.  However, the vessel had not<br>
suffered, for her keel was solidly joined.  But, if she could neither<br>
glide off nor move, she ran the risk of being for ever fastened to<br>
these rocks, and then Captain Nemo's submarine vessel would be done for.<br>
<br>
I was reflecting thus, when the Captain, cool and calm, always master<br>
of himself, approached me.<br>
<br>
"An accident?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"No; an incident."<br>
<br>
"But an incident that will oblige you perhaps to become an inhabitant<br>
of this land from which you flee?"<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo looked at me curiously, and made a negative gesture, as<br>
much as to say that nothing would force him to set foot on terra firma<br>
again.  Then he said:<br>
<br>
"Besides, M. Aronnax, the Nautilus is not lost; it will carry you yet<br>
into the midst of the marvels of the ocean.  Our voyage is only begun,<br>
and I do not wish to be deprived so soon of the honour of your company."<br>
<br>
"However, Captain Nemo," I replied, without noticing the ironical turn<br>
of his phrase, "the Nautilus ran aground in open sea.  Now the tides<br>
are not strong in the Pacific; and, if you cannot lighten the Nautilus,<br>
I do not see how it will be reinflated."<br>
<br>
"The tides are not strong in the Pacific:  you are right there,<br>
Professor; but in Torres Straits one finds still a difference of a yard<br>
and a half between the level of high and low seas.  To-day is 4th<br>
January, and in five days the moon will be full.  Now, I shall be very<br>
much astonished if that satellite does not raise these masses of water<br>
sufficiently, and render me a service that I should be indebted to her<br>
for."<br>
<br>
Having said this, Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, redescended<br>
to the interior of the Nautilus.  As to the vessel, it moved not, and<br>
was immovable, as if the coralline polypi had already walled it up with<br>
their in destructible cement.<br>
<br>
"Well, sir?" said Ned Land, who came up to me after the departure of<br>
the Captain.<br>
<br>
"Well, friend Ned, we will wait patiently for the tide on the 9th<br>
instant; for it appears that the moon will have the goodness to put it<br>
off again."<br>
<br>
"Really?"<br>
<br>
"Really."<br>
<br>
"And this Captain is not going to cast anchor at all since the tide<br>
will suffice?" said Conseil, simply.<br>
<br>
The Canadian looked at Conseil, then shrugged his shoulders.<br>
<br>
"Sir, you may believe me when I tell you that this piece of iron will<br>
navigate neither on nor under the sea again; it is only fit to be sold<br>
for its weight.  I think, therefore, that the time has come to part<br>
company with Captain Nemo."<br>
<br>
"Friend Ned, I do not despair of this stout Nautilus, as you do; and in<br>
four days we shall know what to hold to on the Pacific tides.  Besides,<br>
flight might be possible if we were in sight of the English or<br>
Provencal coast; but on the Papuan shores, it is another thing; and it<br>
will be time enough to come to that extremity if the Nautilus does not<br>
recover itself again, which I look upon as a grave event."<br>
<br>
"But do they know, at least, how to act circumspectly?  There is an<br>
island; on that island there are trees; under those trees, terrestrial<br>
animals, bearers of cutlets and roast beef, to which I would willingly<br>
give a trial."<br>
<br>
"In this, friend Ned is right," said Conseil, "and I agree with him.<br>
Could not master obtain permission from his friend Captain Nemo to put<br>
us on land, if only so as not to lose the habit of treading on the<br>
solid parts of our planet?"<br>
<br>
"I can ask him, but he will refuse."<br>
<br>
"Will master risk it?" asked Conseil, "and we shall know how to rely<br>
upon the Captain's amiability."<br>
<br>
To my great surprise, Captain Nemo gave me the permission I asked for,<br>
and he gave it very agreeably, without even exacting from me a promise<br>
to return to the vessel; but flight across New Guinea might be very<br>
perilous, and I should not have counselled Ned Land to attempt it.<br>
Better to be a prisoner on board the Nautilus than to fall into the<br>
hands of the natives.<br>
<br>
At eight o'clock, armed with guns and hatchets, we got off the<br>
Nautilus.  The sea was pretty calm; a slight breeze blew on land.<br>
Conseil and I rowing, we sped along quickly, and Ned steered in the<br>
straight passage that the breakers left between them.  The boat was<br>
well handled, and moved rapidly.<br>
<br>
Ned Land could not restrain his joy.  He was like a prisoner that had<br>
escaped from prison, and knew not that it was necessary to re-enter it.<br>
<br>
"Meat!  We are going to eat some meat; and what meat!" he replied.<br>
"Real game! no, bread, indeed."<br><a href="../site2/page2_3624.html">link4_text</a>
<br>
"I do not say that fish is not good; we must not abuse it; but a piece<br>
of fresh venison, grilled on live coals, will agreeably vary our<br>
ordinary course."<br>
<br>
"Glutton!" said Conseil, "he makes my mouth water."<br>
<br>
"It remains to be seen," I said, "if these forests are full of game,<br>
and if the game is not such as will hunt the hunter himself."<br>
<br>
"Well said, M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian, whose teeth seemed<br>
sharpened like the edge of a hatchet; "but I will eat tiger--loin of<br>
tiger--if there is no other quadruped on this island."<br>
<br>
"Friend Ned is uneasy about it," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Whatever it may be," continued Ned Land, "every animal with four paws<br>
without feathers, or with two paws without feathers, will be saluted by<br>
my first shot."<br>
<br>
"Very well!  Master Land's imprudences are beginning."<br>
<br>
"Never fear, M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian; "I do not want<br>
twenty-five minutes to offer you a dish, of my sort."<br>
<br>
At half-past eight the Nautilus boat ran softly aground on a heavy<br>
sand, after having happily passed the coral reef that surrounds the<br>
Island of Gilboa.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XX<br>
<br>
A FEW DAYS ON LAND<br>
<br>
I was much impressed on touching land.  Ned Land tried the soil with<br>
his feet, as if to take possession of it.  However, it was only two<br>
months before that we had become, according to Captain Nemo,<br>
"passengers on board the Nautilus," but, in reality, prisoners of its<br>
commander.<br>
<br>
In a few minutes we were within musket-shot of the coast.  The whole<br>
horizon was hidden behind a beautiful curtain of forests.  Enormous<br>
trees, the trunks of which attained a height of 200 feet, were tied to<br>
each other by garlands of bindweed, real natural hammocks, which a<br>
light breeze rocked.  They were mimosas, figs, hibisci, and palm trees,<br>
mingled together in profusion; and under the shelter of their verdant<br>
vault grew orchids, leguminous plants, and ferns.<br>
<br>
But, without noticing all these beautiful specimens of Papua flora,<br>
the Canadian abandoned the agreeable for the useful.  He discovered a<br>
coco-tree, beat down some of the fruit, broke them, and we drunk the<br>
milk and ate the nut with a satisfaction that protested against the<br>
ordinary food on the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
"Excellent!" said Ned Land.<br>
<br>
"Exquisite!" replied Conseil.<br>
<br>
"And I do not think," said the Canadian, "that he would object to our<br>
introducing a cargo of coco-nuts on board."<br>
<br>
"I do not think he would, but he would not taste them."<br>
<br>
"So much the worse for him," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"And so much the better for us," replied Ned Land.  "There will be more<br>
for us."<br>
<br>
"One word only, Master Land," I said to the harpooner, who was<br>
beginning to ravage another coco-nut tree.  "Coco-nuts are good things,<br>
but before filling the canoe with them it would be wise to reconnoitre<br>
and see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful.<br>
Fresh vegetables would be welcome on board the Nautilus."<br>
<br>
"Master is right," replied Conseil; "and I propose to reserve three<br>
places in our vessel, one for fruits, the other for vegetables, and the<br>
third for the venison, of which I have not yet seen the smallest<br>
specimen."<br>
<br>
"Conseil, we must not despair," said the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Let us continue," I returned, "and lie in wait.  Although the island<br>
seems uninhabited, it might still contain some individuals that would<br>
be less hard than we on the nature of game."<br>
<br>
"Ho! ho!" said Ned Land, moving his jaws significantly.<br>
<br>
"Well, Ned!" said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"My word!" returned the Canadian, "I begin to understand the charms of<br>
anthropophagy."<br>
<br>
"Ned!  Ned! what are you saying?  You, a man-eater? I should not feel<br>
safe with you, especially as I share your cabin.  I might perhaps wake<br>
one day to find myself half devoured."<br>
<br>
"Friend Conseil, I like you much, but not enough to eat you<br>
unnecessarily."<br>
<br>
"I would not trust you," replied Conseil.  "But enough.  We must<br>
absolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal, or else one<br>
of these fine mornings, master will find only pieces of his servant to<br>
serve him."<br><a href="../site0/page4_2752.html">link5_text</a>
<br>
While we were talking thus, we were penetrating the sombre arches of<br>
the forest, and for two hours we surveyed it in all directions.<br>
<br>
Chance rewarded our search for eatable vegetables, and one of the most<br>
useful products of the tropical zones furnished us with precious food<br>
that we missed on board.  I would speak of the bread-fruit tree, very<br>
abundant in the island of Gilboa; and I remarked chiefly the variety<br>
destitute of seeds, which bears in Malaya the name of "rima."<br>
<br>
Ned Land knew these fruits well.  He had already eaten many during his<br>
numerous voyages, and he knew how to prepare the eatable substance.<br>
Moreover, the sight of them excited him, and he could contain himself<br>
no longer.<br>
<br>
"Master," he said, "I shall die if I do not taste a little of this<br>
bread-fruit pie."<br>
<br>
"Taste it, friend Ned--taste it as you want.  We are here to make<br>
experiments--make them."<br>
<br>
"It won't take long," said the Canadian.<br>
<br>
And, provided with a lentil, he lighted a fire of dead wood that<br>
crackled joyously.  During this time, Conseil and I chose the best<br>
fruits of the bread-fruit. Some had not then attained a sufficient<br>
degree of maturity; and their thick skin covered a white but rather<br>
fibrous pulp.  Others, the greater number yellow and gelatinous, waited<br>
only to be picked.<br>
<br>
These fruits enclosed no kernel.  Conseil brought a dozen to Ned Land,<br>
who placed them on a coal fire, after having cut them in thick slices,<br>
and while doing this repeating:<br>
<br>
"You will see, master, how good this bread is.  More so when one has<br>
been deprived of it so long.  It is not even bread," added he, "but a<br>
delicate pastry.  You have eaten none, master?"<br>
<br>
"No, Ned."<br>
<br>
"Very well, prepare yourself for a juicy thing.  If you do not come for<br>
more, I am no longer the king of harpooners."<br>
<br>
After some minutes, the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire<br>
was completely roasted.  The interior looked like a white pasty, a sort<br>
of soft crumb, the flavour of which was like that of an artichoke.<br>
<br>
It must be confessed this bread was excellent, and I ate of it with<br>
great relish.<br>
<br>
"What time is it now?" asked the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Two o'clock at least," replied Conseil.<br>
<br>
"How time flies on firm ground!" sighed Ned Land.<br>
<br>
"Let us be off," replied Conseil.<br>
<br>
We returned through the forest, and completed our collection by a raid<br>
upon the cabbage-palms, that we gathered from the tops of the trees,<br>
little beans that I recognised as the "abrou" of the Malays, and yams<br>
of a superior quality.<br>
<br>
We were loaded when we reached the boat.  But Ned Land did not find his<br>
provisions sufficient.  Fate, however, favoured us.  Just as we were<br>
pushing off, he perceived several trees, from twenty-five to thirty<br>
feet high, a species of palm-tree.<br>
<br>
At last, at five o'clock in the evening, loaded with our riches, we<br>
quitted the shore, and half an hour after we hailed the Nautilus.  No<br>
one appeared on our arrival.  The enormous iron-plated cylinder seemed<br>
deserted.  The provisions embarked, I descended to my chamber, and<br>
after supper slept soundly.<br>
<br>
The next day, 6th January, nothing new on board.  Not a sound inside,<br>
not a sign of life.  The boat rested along the edge, in the same place<br>
in which we had left it.  We resolved to return to the island.  Ned<br>
Land hoped to be more fortunate than on the day before with regard to<br>
the hunt, and wished to visit another part of the forest.<br>
<br>
At dawn we set off.  The boat, carried on by the waves that flowed to<br>
shore, reached the island in a few minutes.<br>
<br>
We landed, and, thinking that it was better to give in to the Canadian,<br>
we followed Ned Land, whose long limbs threatened to distance us.  He<br>
wound up the coast towards the west:  then, fording some torrents, he<br>
gained the high plain that was bordered with admirable forests.  Some<br>
kingfishers were rambling along the water-courses, but they would not<br>
let themselves be approached.  Their circumspection proved to me that<br>
these birds knew what to expect from bipeds of our species, and I<br>
concluded that, if the island was not inhabited, at least human beings<br>
occasionally frequented it.<br>
<br>
After crossing a rather large prairie, we arrived at the skirts of a<br>
little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large<br>
number of birds.<br>
<br>
"There are only birds," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"But they are eatable," replied the harpooner.<br>
<br>
"I do not agree with you, friend Ned, for I see only parrots there."<br>
<br>
"Friend Conseil," said Ned, gravely, "the parrot is like pheasant to<br><a href="../site7/page2_8101.html">link6_text</a>
those who have nothing else."<br>
<br>
"And," I added, "this bird, suitably prepared, is worth knife and fork."<br>
<br>
Indeed, under the thick foliage of this wood, a world of parrots were<br>
flying from branch to branch, only needing a careful education to speak<br>
the human language.  For the moment, they were chattering with parrots<br>
of all colours, and grave cockatoos, who seemed to meditate upon some<br>
philosophical problem, whilst brilliant red lories passed like a piece<br>
of bunting carried away by the breeze, papuans, with the finest azure<br>
colours, and in all a variety of winged things most charming to behold,<br>
but few eatable.<br>
<br>
However, a bird peculiar to these lands, and which has never passed the<br>
limits of the Arrow and Papuan islands, was wantig in this collection.<br>
But fortune reserved it for me before long.<br>
<br>
After passing through a moderately thick copse, we found a plain<br>
obstructed with bushes.  I saw then those magnificent birds, the<br>
disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the<br>
wind.  Their undulating flight, graceful aerial curves, and the shading<br>
of their colours, attracted and charmed one's looks.  I had no trouble<br>
in recognising them.<br>
<br>
"Birds of paradise!"  I exclaimed.<br>
<br>
The Malays, who carry on a great trade in these birds with the Chinese,<br>
have several means that we could not employ for taking them.  Sometimes<br>
they put snares on the top of high trees that the birds of paradise<br>
prefer to frequent.  Sometimes they catch them with a viscous birdlime<br>
that paralyses their movements.  They even go so far as to poison the<br>
fountains that the birds generally drink from.  But we were obliged to<br>
fire at them during flight, which gave us few chances to bring them<br>
down; and, indeed, we vainly exhausted one half our ammunition.<br>
<br>
About eleven o'clock in the morning, the first range of mountains that<br>
form the centre of the island was traversed, and we had killed nothing.<br>
Hunger drove us on.  The hunters had relied on the products of the<br>
chase, and they were wrong.  Happily Conseil, to his great surprise,<br>
made a double shot and secured breakfast.  He brought down a white<br>
pigeon and a wood-pigeon, which, cleverly plucked and suspended from a<br>
skewer, was roasted before a red fire of dead wood.  While these<br>
interesting birds were cooking, Ned prepared the fruit of the<br>
bread-tree. Then the wood-pigeons were devoured to the bones, and<br>
declared excellent.  The nutmeg, with which they are in the habit of<br>
stuffing their crops, flavours their flesh and renders it delicious<br>
eating.<br>
<br>
"Now, Ned, what do you miss now?"<br>
<br>
"Some four-footed game, M. Aronnax.  All these pigeons are only<br>
side-dishes and trifles; and until I have killed an animal with cutlets<br>
I shall not be content."<br>
<br>
"Nor I, Ned, if I do not catch a bird of paradise."<br>
<br>
"Let us continue hunting," replied Conseil.  "Let us go towards the<br>
sea.  We have arrived at the first declivities of the mountains, and I<br>
think we had better regain the region of forests."<br>
<br>
That was sensible advice, and was followed out.  After walking for one<br>
hour we had attained a forest of sago-trees. Some inoffensive serpents<br>
glided away from us.  The birds of paradise fled at our approach, and<br>
truly I despaired of getting near one when Conseil, who was walking in<br>
front, suddenly bent down, uttered a triumphal cry, and came back to me<br>
bringing a magnificent specimen.<br>
<br>
"Ah! bravo, Conseil!"<br>
<br>
"Master is very good."<br>
<br>
"No, my boy; you have made an excellent stroke.  Take one of these<br>
living birds, and carry it in your hand."<br>
<br>
"If master will examine it, he will see that I have not deserved great<br>
merit."<br>
<br>
"Why, Conseil?"<br>
<br>
"Because this bird is as drunk as a quail."<br>
<br>
"Drunk!"<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir; drunk with the nutmegs that it devoured under the<br>
nutmeg-tree, under which I found it.  See, friend Ned, see the<br>
monstrous effects of intemperance!"<br>
<br>
"By Jove!" exclaimed the Canadian, "because I have drunk gin for two<br>
months, you must needs reproach me!"<br>
<br>
However, I examined the curious bird.  Conseil was right.  The bird,<br>
drunk with the juice, was quite powerless.  It could not fly; it could<br>
hardly walk.<br>
<br>
This bird belonged to the most beautiful of the eight species that are<br>
found in Papua and in the neighbouring islands.  It was the "large<br>
emerald bird, the most rare kind." It measured three feet in length.<br>
Its head was comparatively small, its eyes placed near the opening of<br>
the beak, and also small.  But the shades of colour were beautiful,<br>
having a yellow beak, brown feet and claws, nut-coloured wings with<br>
purple tips, pale yellow at the back of the neck and head, and emerald<br>
colour at the throat, chestnut on the breast and belly.  Two horned,<br>
downy nets rose from below the tail, that prolonged the long light<br>
feathers of admirable fineness, and they completed the whole of this<br><a href="../site0/page2_2216.html">link7_text</a>
marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the "bird of<br>
the sun."<br>
<br>
But if my wishes were satisfied by the possession of the bird of<br>
paradise, the Canadian's were not yet.  Happily, about two o'clock, Ned<br>
Land brought down a magnificent hog; from the brood of those the<br>
natives call "bari-outang." The animal came in time for us to procure<br>
real quadruped meat, and he was well received.  Ned Land was very proud<br>
of his shot.  The hog, hit by the electric ball, fell stone dead.  The<br>
Canadian skinned and cleaned it properly, after having taken half a<br>
dozen cutlets, destined to furnish us with a grilled repast in the<br>
evening.  Then the hunt was resumed, which was still more marked by Ned<br>
and Conseil's exploits.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the two friends, beating the bushes, roused a herd of kangaroos<br>
that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws.  But these animals<br>
did not take to flight so rapidly but what the electric capsule could<br>
stop their course.<br>
<br>
"Ah, Professor!" cried Ned Land, who was carried away by the delights<br>
of the chase, "what excellent game, and stewed, too!  What a supply for<br>
the Nautilus!  Two! three! five down!  And to think that we shall eat<br>
that flesh, and that the idiots on board shall not have a crumb!"<br>
<br>
I think that, in the excess of his joy, the Canadian, if he had not<br>
talked so much, would have killed them all.  But he contented himself<br>
with a single dozen of these interesting marsupians.  These animals<br>
were small.  They were a species of those "kangaroo rabbits" that live<br>
habitually in the hollows of trees, and whose speed is extreme; but<br>
they are moderately fat, and furnish, at least, estimable food.  We<br>
were very satisfied with the results of the hunt.  Happy Ned proposed<br>
to return to this enchanting island the next day, for he wished to<br>
depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds.  But he had reckoned<br>
without his host.<br>
<br>
At six o'clock in the evening we had regained the shore; our boat was<br>
moored to the usual place.  The Nautilus, like a long rock, emerged<br>
from the waves two miles from the beach.  Ned Land, without waiting,<br>
occupied himself about the important dinner business.  He understood<br>
all about cooking well.  The "bari-outang," grilled on the coals, soon<br>
scented the air with a delicious odour.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the dinner was excellent.  Two wood-pigeons completed this<br>
extraordinary menu.  The sago pasty, the artocarpus bread, some<br>
mangoes, half a dozen pineapples, and the liquor fermented from some<br>
coco-nuts, overjoyed us.  I even think that my worthy companions' ideas<br>
had not all the plainness desirable.<br>
<br>
"Suppose we do not return to the Nautilus this evening?" said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Suppose we never return?" added Ned Land.<br>
<br>
Just then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the harpooner's<br>
proposition.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXI<br>
<br>
CAPTAIN NEMO'S THUNDERBOLT<br>
<br>
We looked at the edge of the forest without rising, my hand stopping in<br>
the action of putting it to my mouth, Ned Land's completing its office.<br>
<br>
"Stones do not fall from the sky," remarked Conseil, "or they would<br>
merit the name aerolites."<br>
<br>
A second stone, carefully aimed, that made a savoury pigeon's leg fall<br>
from Conseil's hand, gave still more weight to his observation.  We all<br>
three arose, shouldered our guns, and were ready to reply to any attack.<br>
<br>
"Are they apes?" cried Ned Land.<br>
<br
"Very nearly--they are savages."<br>
<br>
"To the boat!"  I said, hurrying to the sea.<br>
<br>
It was indeed necessary to beat a retreat, for about twenty natives<br>
armed with bows and slings appeared on the skirts of a copse that<br>
masked the horizon to the right, hardly a hundred steps from us.<br>
<br>
Our boat was moored about sixty feet from us.  The savages approached<br>
us, not running, but making hostile demonstrations.  Stones and arrows<br>
fell thickly.<br>
<br>
Ned Land had not wished to leave his provisions; and, in spite of his<br>
imminent danger, his pig on one side and kangaroos on the other, he<br>
went tolerably fast.  In two minutes we were on the shore.  To load the<br>
boat with provisions and arms, to push it out to sea, and ship the<br>
oars, was the work of an instant.  We had not gone two cable-lengths,<br>
when a hundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water up<br>
to their waists.  I watched to see if their apparition would attract<br>
some men from the Nautilus on to the platform.  But no.  The enormous<br>
machine, lying off, was absolutely deserted.<br>
<br>
Twenty minutes later we were on board.  The panels were open.  After<br>
making the boat fast, we entered into the interior of the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
I descended to the drawing-room, from whence I heard some chords.<br>
Captain Nemo was there, bending over his organ, and plunged in a<br>
musical ecstasy.<br>
<br>
"Captain!"<br>
<br><a href="../site2/page0_1380.html">link8_text</a>
He did not hear me.<br>
<br>
"Captain!"  I said, touching his hand.<br>
<br>
He shuddered, and, turning round, said, "Ah! it is you, Professor?<br>
Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?"<br>
<br>
"Yes Captain; but we have unfortunately brought a troop of bipeds,<br>
whose vicinity troubles me."<br>
<br>
"What bipeds?"<br>
<br>
"Savages."<br>
<br>
"Savages!" he echoed, ironically.  "So you are astonished, Professor,<br>
at having set foot on a strange land and finding savages?  Savages!<br>
where are there not any?  Besides, are they worse than others, these<br>
whom you call savages?"<br>
<br>
"But Captain----"<br>
<br>
"How many have you counted?"<br>
<br>
"A hundred at least."<br>
<br>
"M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, placing his fingers on the organ<br>
stops, "when all the natives of Papua are assembled on this shore, the<br>
Nautilus will have nothing to fear from their attacks."<br>
<br>
The Captain's fingers were then running over the keys of the<br>
instrument, and I remarked that he touched only the black keys, which<br>
gave his melodies an essentially Scotch character.  Soon he had<br>
forgotten my presence, and had plunged into a reverie that I did not<br>
disturb.  I went up again on to the platform: night had already fallen;<br>
for, in this low latitude, the sun sets rapidly and without twilight.<br>
I could only see the island indistinctly; but the numerous fires,<br>
lighted on the beach, showed that the natives did not think of leaving<br>
it.  I was alone for several hours, sometimes thinking of the<br>
natives--but without any dread of them, for the imperturbable<br>
confidence of the Captain was catching--sometimes forgetting them to<br>
admire the splendours of the night in the tropics.  My remembrances<br>
went to France in the train of those zodiacal stars that would shine in<br>
some hours' time.  The moon shone in the midst of the constellations of<br>
the zenith.<br>
<br>
The night slipped away without any mischance, the islanders frightened<br>
no doubt at the sight of a monster aground in the bay.  The panels were<br>
open, and would have offered an easy access to the interior of the<br>
Nautilus.<br>
<br>
At six o'clock in the morning of the 8th January I went up on to the<br>
platform.  The dawn was breaking.  The island soon showed itself<br>
through the dissipating fogs, first the shore, then the summits.<br>
<br>
The natives were there, more numerous than on the day before--five or<br>
six hundred perhaps--some of them, profiting by the low water, had come<br>
on to the coral, at less than two cable-lengths from the Nautilus.  I<br>
distinguished them easily; they were true Papuans, with athletic<br>
figures, men of good race, large high foreheads, large, but not broad<br>
and flat, and white teeth.  Their woolly hair, with a reddish tinge,<br>
showed off on their black shining bodies like those of the Nubians.<br>
From the lobes of their ears, cut and distended, hung chaplets of<br>
bones.  Most of these savages were naked.  Amongst them, I remarked<br>
some women, dressed from the hips to knees in quite a crinoline of<br>
herbs, that sustained a vegetable waistband.  Some chiefs had<br>
ornamented their necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads, red<br>
and white; nearly all were armed with bows, arrows, and shields and<br>
carried on their shoulders a sort of net containing those round stones<br>
which they cast from their slings with great skill.  One of these<br>
chiefs, rather near to the Nautilus, examined it attentively.  He was,<br>
perhaps, a "mado" of high rank, for he was draped in a mat of<br>
banana-leaves, notched round the edges, and set off with brilliant<br>
colours.<br>
<br>
I could easily have knocked down this native, who was within a short<br>
length; but I thought that it was better to wait for real hostile<br>
demonstrations.  Between Europeans and savages, it is proper for the<br>
Europeans to parry sharply, not to attack.<br>
<br>
During low water the natives roamed about near the Nautilus, but were<br>
not troublesome; I heard them frequently repeat the word "Assai," and<br>
by their gestures I understood that they invited me to go on land, an<br>
invitation that I declined.<br>
<br>
So that, on that day, the boat did not push off, to the great<br>
displeasure of Master Land, who could not complete his provisions.<br>
<br>
This adroit Canadian employed his time in preparing the viands and meat<br>
that he had brought off the island.  As for the savages, they returned<br>
to the shore about eleven o'clock in the morning, as soon as the coral<br>
tops began to disappear under the rising tide; but I saw their numbers<br>
had increased considerably on the shore.  Probably they came from the<br>
neighbouring islands, or very likely from Papua.  However, I had not<br>
seen a single native canoe.  Having nothing better to do, I thought of<br>
dragging these beautiful limpid waters, under which I saw a profusion<br>
of shells, zoophytes, and marine plants.  Moreover, it was the last day<br>
that the Nautilus would pass in these parts, if it float in open sea<br>
the next day, according to Captain Nemo's promise.<br>
<br>
I therefore called Conseil, who brought me a little light drag, very<br>
like those for the oyster fishery.  Now to work!  For two hours we<br>
fished unceasingly, but without bringing up any rarities.  The drag was<br>
filled with midas-ears, harps, melames, and particularly the most<br>
beautiful hammers I have ever seen.  We also brought up some sea-slugs,<br><a href="../site0/page8_8101.html">link9_text</a>
pearl-oysters, and a dozen little turtles that were reserved for the<br>
pantry on board.<br>
<br>
But just when I expected it least, I put my hand on a wonder, I might<br>
say a natural deformity, very rarely met with.  Conseil was just<br>
dragging, and his net came up filled with divers ordinary shells, when,<br>
all at once, he saw me plunge my arm quickly into the net, to draw out<br>
a shell, and heard me utter a cry.<br>
<br>
"What is the matter, sir?" he asked in surprise.  "Has master been<br>
bitten?"<br>
<br>
"No, my boy; but I would willingly have given a finger for my<br>
discovery."<br>
<br>
"What discovery?"<br>
<br>
"This shell," I said, holding up the object of my triumph.<br>
<br>
"It is simply an olive porphyry, genus olive, order of the<br>
pectinibranchidae, class of gasteropods, sub-class mollusca."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Conseil; but, instead of being rolled from right toleft, this<br>
olive turns from left to right."<br>
<br>
"Is it possible?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, my boy; it is a left shell."<br>
<br>
Shells are all right-handed, with rare exceptions; and, when by chance<br>
their spiral is left, amateurs are ready to pay their weight in gold.<br>
<br>
Conseil and I were absorbed in the contemplation of our treasure, and I<br>
was promising myself to enrich the museum with it, when a stone<br>
unfortunately thrown by a native struck against, and broke, the<br>
precious object in Conseil's hand.  I uttered a cry of despair!<br>
Conseil took up his gun, and aimed at a savage who was poising his<br>
sling at ten yards from him.  I would have stopped him, but his blow<br>
took effect and broke the bracelet of amulets which encircled the arm<br>
of the savage.<br>
<br>
"Conseil!" cried I. "Conseil!"<br>
<br>
"Well, sir! do you not see that the cannibal has commenced the attack?"<br>
<br>
"A shell is not worth the life of a man," said I.<br>
<br>
"Ah! the scoundrel!" cried Conseil; "I would rather he had broken my<br>
shoulder!"<br>
<br>
Conseil was in earnest, but I was not of his opinion.  However, the<br>
situation had changed some minutes before, and we had not perceived.  A<br>
score of canoes surrounded the Nautilus.  These canoes, scooped out of<br>
the trunk of a tree, long, narrow, well adapted for speed, were<br>
balanced by means of a long bamboo pole, which floated on the water.<br>
They were managed by skilful, half-naked paddlers, and I watched their<br>
advance with some uneasiness.  It was evident that these Papuans had<br>
already had dealings with the Europeans and knew their ships.  But this<br>
long iron cylinder anchored in the bay, without masts or chimneys, what<br>
could they think of it?  Nothing good, for at first they kept at a<br>
respectful distance.  However, seeing it motionless, by degrees they<br>
took courage, and sought to familiarise themselves with it.  Now this<br>
familiarity was precisely what it was necessary to avoid.  Our arms,<br>
which were noiseless, could only produce a moderate effect on the<br>
savages, who have little respect for aught but blustering things.  The<br>
thunderbolt without the reverberations of thunder would frighten man<br>
but little, though the danger lies in the lightning, not in the noise.<br>
<br>
At this moment the canoes approached the Nautilus, and a shower of<br>
arrows alighted on her.<br>
<br>
I went down to the saloon, but found no one there.  I ventured to knock<br>
at the door that opened into the Captain's room.  "Come in," was the<br>
answer.<br>
<br>
I entered, and found Captain Nemo deep in algebraical calculations of<br>
_x_ and other quantities.<br>
<br>
"I am disturbing you," said I, for courtesy's sake.<br>
<br>
"That is true, M. Aronnax," replied the Captain; "but I think you have<br>
serious reasons for wishing to see me?"<br>
<br>
"Very grave ones; the natives are surrounding us in their canoes, and<br>
in a few minutes we shall certainly be attacked by many hundreds of<br>
savages."<br>
<br>
"Ah!" said Captain Nemo quietly, "they are come with their canoes?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir."<br>
<br>
"Well, sir, we must close the hatches."<br>
<br>
"Exactly, and I came to say to you----"<br>
<br>
"Nothing can be more simple," said Captain Nemo.  And, pressing an<br>
electric button, he transmitted an order to the ship's crew.<br>
<br>
"It is all done, sir," said he, after some moments.  "The pinnace is<br>
ready, and the hatches are closed.  You do not fear, I imagine, that<br>
these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate<br>
have had no effect?"<br>
<br>
"No, Captain; but a danger still exists."<br><a href="../site0/page3_4503.html">link10_text</a>
