had spoken so much.  But I had guessed that, whatever the motive which<br>
had forced him to seek independence under the sea, it had left him<br>
still a man, that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity,<br>
and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as<br>
individuals.  And I then understood for whom those millions were<br>
destined which were forwarded by Captain Nemo when the Nautilus was<br>
cruising in the waters of Crete.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX<br>
<br>
A VANISHED CONTINENT<br>
<br>
The next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my<br>
room.  I expected this visit.  He looked very disappointed.<br>
<br>
"Well, sir?" said he.<br>
<br>
"Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday."<br>
<br>
"Yes; that Captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended<br>
leaving his vessel."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Ned, he had business at his bankers."<br>
<br>
"His bankers!"<br>
<br>
"Or rather his banking-house; by that I mean the ocean, where his<br>
riches are safer than in the chests of the State."<br>
<br>
I then related to the Canadian the incidents of the preceding night,<br>
hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but<br>
my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret<br>
from Ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of<br>
Vigo on his own account.<br>
<br>
"However," said he, "all is not ended.  It is only a blow of the<br>
harpoon lost.  Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if<br>
necessary----"<br>
<br>
"In what direction is the Nautilus going?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"I do not know," replied Ned.<br>
<br>
"Well, at noon we shall see the point."<br>
<br>
The Canadian returned to Conseil.  As soon as I was dressed, I went<br>
into the saloon.  The compass was not reassuring.  The course of the<br>
Nautilus was S.S.W. We were turning our backs on Europe.<br>
<br>
I waited with some impatience till the ship's place was pricked on the<br>
chart.  At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and our<br>
vessel rose to the surface of the ocean.  I rushed towards the<br>
platform.  Ned Land had preceded me.  No more land in sight.  Nothing<br>
but an immense sea.  Some sails on the horizon, doubtless those going<br>
to San Roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of<br>
Good Hope.  The weather was cloudy.  A gale of wind was preparing.  Ned<br>
raved, and tried to pierce the cloudy horizon.  He still hoped that<br>
behind all that fog stretched the land he so longed for.<br>
<br>
At noon the sun showed itself for an instant.  The second profited by<br>
this brightness to take its height.  Then, the sea becoming more<br>
billowy, we descended, and the panel closed.<br>
<br>
An hour after, upon consulting the chart, I saw the position of the<br>
Nautilus was marked at 16° 17' long., and 33° 22' lat., at 150<br>
leagues from the nearest coast.  There was no means of flight, and I<br>
leave you to imagine the rage of the Canadian when I informed him of<br>
our situation.<br>
<br>
For myself, I was not particularly sorry.  I felt lightened of the load<br>
which had oppressed me, and was able to return with some degree of<br>
calmness to my accustomed work.<br>
<br>
That night, about eleven o'clock, I received a most unexpected visit<br>
from Captain Nemo.  He asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from<br>
my watch of the preceding night.  I answered in the negative.<br>
<br>
"Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion."<br>
<br>
"Propose, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"You have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight, under<br>
the brightness of the sun.  Would it suit you to see them in the<br>
darkness of the night?"<br>
<br>
"Most willingly."<br>
<br>
"I warn you, the way will be tiring.  We shall have far to walk, and<br>
must climb a mountain.  The roads are not well kept."<br>
<br>
"What you say, Captain, only heightens my curiosity; I am ready to<br>
follow you."<br>
<br>
"Come then, sir, we will put on our diving-dresses."<br>
<br>
Arrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any<br>
of the ship's crew were to follow us on this excursion.  Captain Nemo<br>
had not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil.<br>
<br>
In a few moments we had put on our diving-dresses; they placed on our<br>
backs the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps<br>
were prepared.  I called the Captain's attention to the fact.<br>
<br>
"They will be useless," he replied.<br>
<br>
I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my<br>
observation, for the Captain's head had already disappeared in its<br>
metal case.  I finished harnessing myself.  I felt them put an<br>
iron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going<br>
through the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a<br>
depth of 150 fathoms.  Midnight was near.  The waters were profoundly<br>
dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a<br>
sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the<br>
Nautilus.  What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it<br>
lit up the liquid mass, I could not say.  In any case, it did light our<br>
way, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar<br>
darkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness<br>
of the Ruhmkorff apparatus.<br>
<br>
As we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head.  The noise<br>
redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood<br>
the cause.  It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of<br>
the waves.  Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I<br>
should be wet through!  By the water! in the midst of the water!  I<br>
could not help laughing at the odd idea.  But, indeed, in the thick<br>
diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems<br>
to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere.<br>
Nothing more.<br>
<br>
After half an hour's walk the soil became stony.  Medusae, microscopic<br>
crustacea, and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent<br>
gleam.  I caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of<br>
zoophytes and masses of sea weed.  My feet often slipped upon this<br>
sticky carpet of sea weed, and without my iron-tipped stick I should<br>
have fallen more than once.  In turning round, I could still see the<br>
whitish lantern of the Nautilus beginning to pale in the distance.<br>
<br>
But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon.<br>
The presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree.<br>
Was I going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the _savants_<br>
of the earth?  Or even (for this thought crossed my brain) had the hand<br>
of man aught to do with this conflagration?  Had he fanned this flame?<br>
Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of Captain Nemo<br>
whom he was going to visit, and who, like him, led this strange<br>
existence?  Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who,<br>
weary of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence<br>
in the deep ocean?  All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued<br>
me.  And in this condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of<br>
wonders continually passing before my eyes, I should not have been<br>
surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns<br>
of which Captain Nemo dreamed.<br>
<br>
Our road grew lighter and lighter.  The white glimmer came in rays from<br>
the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high.  But what I saw was<br>
simply a reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters.  The<br>
source of this inexplicable light was a fireon the opposite side of<br>
the mountain.<br>
<br>
In the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic,<br>
Captain Nemo advanced without hesitation.  He knew this dreary road.<br>
Doubtless he had often travelled over it, and could not lose himself.<br>
I followed him with unshaken confidence.  He seemed to me like a genie<br>
of the sea; and, as he walked before me, I could not help admiring his<br>
stature, which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon.<br>
<br>
It was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the<br>
mountain; but to gain access to them we must venture through the<br>
difficult paths of a vast copse.<br>
<br>
Yes; a copse of dead trees, without leaves, without sap, trees<br><a href="../site1/page7_6176.html">link1_text</a>
petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by<br>
gigantic pines.  It was like a coal-pit still standing, holding by the<br>
roots to the broken soil, and whose branches, like fine black paper<br>
cuttings, showed distinctly on the watery ceiling.  Picture to yourself<br>
a forest in the Hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain, but a<br>
forest swallowed up.  The paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus,<br>
between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea.  I went along,<br>
climbing the rocks, striding over extended trunks, breaking the sea<br>
bind-weed which hung from one tree to the other; and frightening the<br>
fishes, which flew from branch to branch.  Pressing onward, I felt no<br>
fatigue.  I followed my guide, who was never tired.  What a spectacle!<br>
How can I express it? how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in<br>
this medium--their under parts dark and wild, the upper coloured with<br>
red tints, by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters<br>
doubled?  We climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic<br>
bounds and the low growling of an avalanche.  To right and left ran<br>
long, dark galleries, where sight was lost.  Here opened vast glades<br>
which the hand of man seemed to have worked; and I sometimes asked<br>
myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly<br>
appear to me.<br>
<br>
But Captain Nemo was still mounting.  I could not stay behind.  I<br>
followed boldly.  My stick gave me good help.  A false step would have<br>
been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the<br>
gulfs; but I walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness.  Now<br>
I jumped a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had<br>
it been among the glaciers on the land; now I ventured on the unsteady<br>
trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without<br>
looking under my feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of<br>
this region.<br>
<br>
There, monumental rocks, leaning on their regularly-cut bases, seemed<br>
to defy all laws of equilibrium.  From between their stony knees trees<br>
sprang, like a jet under heavy pressure, and upheld others which upheld<br>
them.  Natural towers, large scarps, cut perpendicularly, like a<br>
"curtain," inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could<br>
never have tolerated in terrestrial regions.<br>
<br>
Two hours after quitting the Nautilus we had crossed the line of trees,<br>
and a hundred feet above our heads rose the top of the mountain, which<br>
cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope.  Some<br>
petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there.  Fishes got up under<br>
our feet like birds in the long grass.  The massive rocks were rent<br>
with impenetrable fractures, deep grottos, and unfathomable holes, at<br>
the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving.  My<br>
blood curdled when I saw enormous antennae blocking my road, or some<br>
frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity.<br>
Millions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness.<br>
They were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their holes; giant<br>
lobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers, and moving their claws<br>
with the clicking sound of pincers; titanic crabs, pointed like a gun<br>
on its carriage; and frightful-looking poulps, interweaving their<br>
tentacles like a living nest of serpents.<br>
<br>
We had now arrived on the first platform, where other surprises awaited<br>
me.  Before us lay some picturesque ruins, which betrayed the hand of<br>
man and not that of the Creator.  There were vast heaps of stone,<br>
amongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles<br>
and temples, clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes, and over<br>
which, instead of ivy, sea-weed and fucus threw a thick vegetable<br>
mantle.  But what was this portion of the globe which had been<br>
swallowed by cataclysms?  Who had placed those rocks and stones like<br>
cromlechs of prehistoric times?  Where was I?  Whither had Captain<br>
Nemo's fancy hurried me?<br>
<br>
I would fain have asked him; not being able to, I stopped him--I seized<br>
his arm.  But, shaking his head, and pointing to the highest point of<br>
the mountain, he seemed to say:<br>
<br>
"Come, come along; come higher!"<br>
<br>
I followed, and in a few minutes I had climbed to the top, which for a<br>
circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock.<br>
<br>
I looked down the side we had just climbed.  The mountain did not rise<br>
more than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain; but<br>
on the opposite side it commanded from twice that height the depths of<br>
this part of the Atlantic.  My eyes ranged far over a large space lit<br>
by a violent fulguration.  In fact, the mountain was a volcano.<br>
<br>
At fifty feet above the peak, in the midst of a rain of stones and<br>
scoriae, a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell<br>
in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass.  Thus situated,<br>
this volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch, even to the<br>
extreme limits of the horizon.  I said that the submarine crater threw<br>
up lava, but no flames.  Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed<br>
upon and cannot be developed under water; but streams of lava, having<br>
in themselves the principles of their incandescence, can attain a white<br>
heat, fight vigorously against the liquid element, and turn it to<br>
vapour by contact.<br>
<br>
Rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of<br>
lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on<br>
another Terra del Greco.<br>
<br>
There indeed under my eyes, ruined, destroyed, lay a town--its roofs<br>
open to the sky, its temples fallen, its arches dislocated, its columns<br>
lying on the ground, from which one would still recognise the massive<br>
character of Tuscan architecture.  Further on, some remains of a<br>
gigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the<br>
floating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if an<br>
ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and<br>
disappeared with its merchant vessels and its war-galleys. Farther on<br>
again, long lines of sunken walls and broad, deserted streets--a<br>
perfect Pompeii escaped beneath the waters.  Such was the sight that<br>
Captain Nemo brought before my eyes!<br>
<br>
Where was I?  Where was I?  I must know at any cost.  I tried to speak,<br>
but Captain Nemo stopped me by a gesture, and, picking up a piece of<br>
chalk-stone, advanced to a rock of black basalt, and traced the one<br>
word:<br>
<br>
<br>
ATLANTIS<br>
<br>
<br>
What a light shot through my mind!  Atlantis! the Atlantis of Plato,<br>
that continent denied by Origen and Humbolt, who placed its<br>
disappearance amongst the legendary tales.  I had it there now before<br>
my eyes, bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its<br>
catastrophe.  The region thus engulfed was beyond Europe, Asia, and<br>
Lybia, beyond the columns of Hercules, where those powerfulpeople, the<br>
Atlantides, lived, against whom the first wars of ancient Greeks were<br>
waged.<br>
<br>
Thus, led by the strangest destiny, I was treading under foot the<br>
mountains of this continent, touching with my hand those ruins a<br>
thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs.<br>
I was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first<br>
man had walked.<br>
<br>
Whilst I was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand<br>
landscape, Captain Nemo remained motionless, as if petrified in mute<br>
ecstasy, leaning on a mossy stone.  Was he dreaming of those<br>
generations long since disappeared?  Was he asking them the secret of<br>
human destiny?  Was it here this strange man came to steep himself in<br>
historical recollections, and live again this ancient life--he who<br>
wanted no modern one?  What would I not have given to know his<br>
thoughts, to share them, to understand them!  We remained for an hour<br>
at this place, contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of<br>
the lava, which was some times wonderfully intense.  Rapid tremblings<br>
ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings, deep noise,<br>
distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with<br>
majestic grandeur.  At this moment the moon appeared through the mass<br>
of waters and threw her pale rays on the buried continent.  It was but<br>
a gleam, but what an indescribable effect!  The Captain rose, cast one<br>
last look on the immense plain, and then bade me follow him.<br>
<br>
We descended the mountain rapidly, and, the mineral forest once passed,<br>
I saw the lantern of the Nautilus shining like a star.  The Captain<br>
walked straight to it, and we got on board as the first rays of light<br>
whitened the surface of the ocean.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER X<br>
<br>
THE SUBMARINE COAL-MINES<br>
<br>
The next day, the 20th of February, I awoke very late:  the fatigues of<br>
the previous night had prolonged my sleep until eleven o'clock. I<br>
dressed quickly, and hastened to find the course the Nautilus was<br>
taking.  The instruments showed it to be still toward the south, with a<br>
speed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms.<br>
<br>
The species of fishes here did not differ much from those already<br>
noticed.  There were rays of giant size, five yards long, and endowed<br>
with great muscular strength, which enabled them to shoot above the<br>
waves; sharks of many kinds; amongst others, one fifteen feet long,<br>
with triangular sharp teeth, and whose transparency rendered it almost<br>
invisible in the water.<br><a href="../site3/page1_7999.html">link2_text</a>
<br>
Amongst bony fish Conseil noticed some about three yards long, armed at<br>
the upper jaw with a piercing sword; other bright-coloured creatures,<br>
known in the time of Aristotle by the name of the sea-dragon, which are<br>
dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back.<br>
<br>
About four o'clock, the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed<br>
with petrified wood, changed by degrees, and it became more stony, and<br>
seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt, with a sprinkling<br>
of lava.  I thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long<br>
plains; and accordingly, after a few evolutions of the Nautilus, I saw<br>
the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close all<br>
exit.  Its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean.  It must be<br>
a continent, or at least an island--one of the Canaries, or of the Cape<br>
Verde Islands.  The bearings not being yet taken, perhaps designedly, I<br>
was ignorant of our exact position.  In any case, such a wall seemed to<br>
me to mark the limits of that Atlantis, of which we had in reality<br>
passed over only the smallest part.<br>
<br>
Much longer should I have remained at the window admiring the beauties<br>
of sea and sky, but the panels closed.  At this moment the Nautilus<br>
arrived at the side of this high, perpendicular wall.  What it would<br>
do, I could not guess.  I returned to my room; it no longer moved.  I<br>
laid myself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours'<br>
sleep; but it was eight o'clock the next day when I entered the saloon.<br>
I looked at the manometer.  It told me that the Nautilus was floating<br>
on the surface of the ocean.  Besides, I heard steps on the platform.<br>
I went to the panel.  It was open; but, instead of broad daylight, as I<br>
expected, I was surrounded by profound darkness.  Where were we?  Was I<br>
mistaken?  Was it still night?  No; not a star was shining and night<br>
has not that utter darkness.<br>
<br>
I knew not what to think, when a voice near me said:<br>
<br>
"Is that you, Professor?"<br>
<br>
"Ah!  Captain," I answered, "where are we?"<br>
<br>
"Underground, sir."<br>
<br>
"Underground!"  I exclaimed.  "And the Nautilus floating still?"<br>
<br>
"It always floats."<br>
<br>
"But I do not understand."<br>
<br>
"Wait a few minutes, our lantern will be lit, and, if you like light<br>
places, you will be satisfied."<br>
<br>
I stood on the platform and waited.  The darkness was so complete that<br>
I could not even see Captain Nemo; but, looking to the zenith, exactly<br>
above my head, I seemed to catch an undecided gleam, a kind of twilight<br>
filling a circular hole.  At this instant the lantern was lit, and its<br>
vividness dispelled the faint light.  I closed my dazzled eyes for an<br>
instant, and then looked again.  The Nautilus was stationary, floating<br>
near a mountain which formed a sort of quay.  The lake, then,<br>
supporting it was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls, measuring two<br>
miles in diameter and six in circumference.  Its level (the manometer<br>
showed) could only be the same as the outside level, for there must<br>
necessarily be a communication between the lake and the sea.  The high<br>
partitions, leaning forward on their base, grew into a vaulted roof<br>
bearing the shape of an immense funnel turned upside down, the height<br>
being about five or six hundred yards.  At the summit was a circular<br>
orifice, by which I had caught the slight gleam of light, evidently<br>
daylight.<br>
<br>
"Where are we?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"In the very heart of an extinct volcano, the interior of which has<br>
been invaded by the sea, after some great convulsion of the earth.<br>
Whilst you were sleeping, Professor, the Nautilus penetrated to this<br>
lagoon by a natural canal, which opens about ten yards beneath the<br>
surface of the ocean.  This is its harbour of refuge, a sure,<br>
commodious, and mysterious one, sheltered from all gales.  Show me, if<br>
you can, on the coasts of any of your continents or islands, a road<br>
which can give such perfect refuge from all storms."<br>
<br>
"Certainly," I replied, "you are in safety here, Captain Nemo.  Who<br>
could reach you in the heart of a volcano?  But did I not see an<br>
opening at its summit?"<br>
<br>
"Yes; its crater, formerly filled with lava, vapour, and flames, and<br>
which now gives entrance to the life-giving air we breathe."<br>
<br>
"But what is this volcanic mountain?"<br>
<br>
"It belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is<br>
strewn--to vessels a simple sandbank--to us an immense cavern.  Chance<br>
led me to discover it, and chance served me well."<br>
<br>
"But of what use is this refuge, Captain?  The Nautilus wants no port."<br>
<br>
"No, sir; but it wants electricity to make it move, and the wherewithal<br>
to make the electricity--sodium to feed the elements, coal from which<br>
to get the sodium, and a coal-mine to supply the coal.  And exactly on<br>
this spot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological<br>
periods, now mineralised and transformed into coal; for me they are an<br>
inexhaustible mine."<br>
<br>
"Your men follow the trade of miners here, then, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"Exactly so.  These mines extend under the wave like the mines of<br>
Newcastle.  Here, in their diving-dresses, pick axe and shovel in hand,<br>
my men extract the coal, which I do not even ask from the mines of the<br>
earth.  When I burn this combustible for the manufacture of sodium, the<br>
smoke, escaping from the crater of the mountain, gives it the<br>
appearance of a still-active volcano."<br>
<br>
"And we shall see your companions at work?"<br>
<br>
"No; not this time at least; for I am in a hurry to continue our<br>
submarine tour of the earth.  So I shall content myself with drawing<br>
from the reserve of sodium I already possess.  The time for loading is<br>
one day only, and we continue our voyage.  So, if you wish to go over<br>
the cavern and make the round of the lagoon, you must take advantage of<br>
to-day, M. Aronnax."<br>
<br>
I thanked the Captain and went to look for my companions, who had not<br>
yet left their cabin.  I invited them to follow me without saying where<br>
we were.  They mounted the platform.  Conseil, who was astonished at<br>
nothing, seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake<br>
under a mountain, after having fallen asleep under the waves.  But Ned<br>
Land thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit.<br>
After breakfast, about ten o'clock, we went down on to the mountain.<br>
<br>
"Here we are, once more on land," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"I do not call this land," said the Canadian.  "And besides, we are not<br>
on it, but beneath it."<br>
<br>
Between the walls of the mountains and the waters of the lake lay a<br>
sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet.<br>
On this soil one might easily make the tour of the lake.  But the base<br>
of the high partitions was stony ground, with volcanic locks and<br>
enormous pumice-stones lying in picturesque heaps.  All these detached<br>
masses, covered with enamel, polished by the action of the<br>
subterraneous fires, shone resplendent by the light of our electric<br>
lantern.  The mica dust from the shore, rising under our feet, flew<br>
like a cloud of sparks.  The bottom now rose sensibly, and we soon<br>
arrived at long circuitous slopes, or inclined planes, which took us<br>
higher by degrees; but we were obliged to walk carefully among these<br>
conglomerates, bound by no cement, the feet slipping on the glassy<br>
crystal, felspar, and quartz.<br>
<br>
The volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was confirmed on all<br>
sides, and I pointed it out to my companions.<br>
<br>
"Picture to yourselves," said I, "what this crater must have been when<br>
filled with boiling lava, and when the level of the incandescent liquid<br>
rose to the orifice of the mountain, as though melted on the top of a<br>
hot plate."<br>
<br>
"I can picture it perfectly," said Conseil.  "But, sir, will you tell<br>
me why the Great Architect has suspended operations, and how it is that<br>
the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake?"<br>
<br>
"Most probably, Conseil, because some convulsion beneath the ocean<br>
produced that very opening which has served as a passage for the<br>
Nautilus.  Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed into the interior of<br>
the mountain.  There must have been a terrible struggle between the two<br>
elements, a struggle which ended in the victory of Neptune.  But many<br>
ages have run out since then, and the submerged volcano is now a<br>
peaceable grotto."<br>
<br>
"Very well," replied Ned Land; "I accept the explanation, sir; but, in<br>
our own interests, I regret that the opening of which you speak was not<br>
made above the level of the sea."<br>
<br>
"But, friend Ned," said Conseil, "if the passage had not been under the<br>
sea, the Nautilus could not have gone through it."<br>
<br><a href="../site5/page8_6348.html">link3_text</a>
We continued ascending.  The steps became more and more perpendicular<br>
and narrow.  Deep excavations, which we were obliged to cross, cut them<br>
here and there; sloping masses had to be turned.  We slid upon our<br>
knees and crawled along.  But Conseil's dexterity and the Canadian's<br>
strength surmounted all obstacles.  At a height of about 31 feet the<br>
nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable.  To the<br>
conglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt, the first dispread in<br>
layers full of bubbles, the latter forming regular prisms, placed like<br>
a colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault, an admirable<br>
specimen of natural architecture.  Between the blocks of basalt wound<br>
long streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous<br>
rays; and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur.  A<br>
more powerful light shone through the upper crater, shedding a vague<br>
glimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of<br>
this extinguished mountain.  But our upward march was soon stopped at a<br>
height of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles.<br>
There was a complete vaulted arch overhanging us, and our ascent was<br>
changed to a circular walk.  At the last change vegetable life began to<br>
struggle with the mineral.  Some shrubs, and even some trees, grew from<br>
the fractures of the walls.  I recognised some euphorbias, with the<br>
caustic sugar coming from them; heliotropes, quite incapable of<br>
justifying their name, sadly drooped their clusters of flowers, both<br>
their colour and perfume half gone.  Here and there some chrysanthemums<br>
grew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long, sickly-looking leaves.<br>
But between the streams of lava, I saw some little violets still<br>
slightly perfumed, and I admit that I smelt them with delight.  Perfume<br>
is the soul of the flower, and sea-flowers have no soul.<br>
<br>
We had arrived at the foot of some sturdy dragon-trees, which had<br>
pushed aside the rocks with their strong roots, when Ned Land exclaimed:<br>
<br>
"Ah! sir, a hive! a hive!"<br>
<br>
"A hive!"  I replied, with a gesture of incredulity.<br>
<br>
"Yes, a hive," repeated the Canadian, "and bees humming round it."<br>
<br>
I approached, and was bound to believe my own eyes.  There at a hole<br>
bored in one of the dragon-trees were some thousands of these ingenious<br>
insects, so common in all the Canaries, and whose produce is so much<br>
esteemed.  Naturally enough, the Canadian wished to gather the honey,<br>
and I could not well oppose his wish.  A quantity of dry leaves, mixed<br>
with sulphur, he lit with a spark from his flint, and he began to smoke<br>
out the bees.  The humming ceased by degrees, and the hive eventually<br>
yielded several pounds of the sweetest honey, with which Ned Land<br>
filled his haversack.<br>
<br>
"When I have mixed this honey with the paste of the bread-fruit," said<br>
he, "I shall be able to offer you a succulent cake."<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's Note: 'bread-fruit' has been substituted for<br>
'artocarpus' in this ed.]<br>
<br>
"'Pon my word," said Conseil, "it will be gingerbread."<br>
<br>
"Never mind the gingerbread," said I; "let us continue our interesting<br>
walk."<br>
<br>
At every turn of the path we were following, the lake appeared in all<br>
its length and breadth.  The lantern lit up the whole of its peaceable<br>
surface, which knew neither ripple nor wave.  The Nautilus remained<br>
perfectly immovable.  On the platform, and on the mountain, the ship's<br>
crew were working like black shadows clearly carved against the<br>
luminous atmosphere.  We were now going round the highest crest of the<br>
first layers of rock which upheld the roof.  I then saw that bees were<br>
not the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of<br>
this volcano.  Birds of prey hovered here and there in the shadows, or<br>
fled from their nests on the top of the rocks.  There were sparrow<br>
hawks, with white breasts, and kestrels, and down the slopes scampered,<br>
with their long legs, several fine fat bustards.  I leave anyone to<br>
imagin the covetousness of the Canadian at the sight of this savoury<br>
game, and whether he did not regret having no gun.  But he did his best<br>
to replace the lead by stones, and, after several fruitless attempts,<br>
he succeeded in wounding a magnificent bird.  To say that he risked his<br>
life twenty times before reaching it is but the truth; but he managed<br>
so well that the creature joined the honey-cakes in his bag.  We were<br>
now obliged to descend toward the shore, the crest becoming<br>
impracticable.  Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a<br>
well.  From this place the sky could be clearly seen, and clouds,<br>
dissipated by the west wind, leaving behind them, even on the summit of<br>
the mountain, their misty remnants--certain proof that they were only<br>
moderately high, for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred<br>
feet above the level of the ocean.  Half an hour after the Canadian's<br>
last exploit we had regained the inner shore.  Here the flora was<br>
represented by large carpets of marine crystal, a little umbelliferous<br>
plant very good to pickle, which also bears the name of pierce-stone<br>
and sea-fennel. Conseil gathered some bundles of it.  As to the fauna,<br>
it might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts, lobsters,<br>
crabs, spider-crabs, chameleon shrimps, and a large number of shells,<br>
rockfish, and limpets.  Three-quarters of an hour later we had finished<br>
our circuitous walk and were on board.  The crew had just finished<br>
loading the sodium, and the Nautilus could have left that instant.  But<br>
Captain Nemo gave no order.  Did he wish to wait until night, and leave<br>
the submarine passage secretly?  Perhaps so.  Whatever it might be, the<br>
next day, the Nautilus, having left its port, steered clear of all land<br>
at a few yards beneath the waves of the Atlantic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XI<br>
<br>
THE SARGASSO SEA<br>
<br>
That day the Nautilus crossed a singular part of the Atlantic Ocean.<br>
No one can be ignorant of the existence of a current of warm water<br>
known by the name of the Gulf Stream.  After leaving the Gulf of<br>
Florida, we went in the direction of Spitzbergen.  But before entering<br>
the Gulf of Mexico, about 45° of N. lat., this current divides into<br>
two arms, the principal one going towards the coast of Ireland and<br>
Norway, whilst the second bends to the south about the height of the<br>
Azores; then, touching the African shore, and describing a lengthened<br>
oval, returns to the Antilles.  This second arm--it is rather a collar<br>
than an arm--surrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of<br>
the cold, quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect<br>
lake in the open Atlantic: it takes no less than three years for the<br>
great current to pass round it.  Such was the region the Nautilus was<br>
now visiting, a perfect meadow, a close carpet of seaweed, fucus, and<br>
tropical berries, so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel<br>
could hardly tear its way through it.  And Captain Nemo, not wishing to<br>
entangle his screw in this herbaceous mass, kept some yards beneath the<br>
surface of the waves.  The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word<br>
"sargazzo" which signifies kelp.  This kelp, or berry-plant, is the<br>
principal formation of this immense bank.  And this is the reason why<br>
these plants unite in the peaceful basin of the Atlantic.  The only<br>
explanation which can be given, he says, seems to me to result from the<br>
experience known to all the world.  Place in a vase some fragments of<br>
cork or other floating body, and give to the water in the vase a<br>
circular movement, the scattered fragments will unite in a group in the<br>
centre of the liquid surface, that is to say, in the part least<br>
agitated.  In the phenomenon we are considering, the Atlantic is the<br>
vase, the Gulf Stream the circular current, and the Sargasso Sea the<br>
central point at which the floating bodies unite.<br>
<br>
I share Maury's opinion, and I was able to study the phenomenon in the<br>
very midst, where vessels rarely penetrate.  Above us floated products<br>
of all kinds, heaped up among these brownish plants; trunks of trees<br>
torn from the Andes or the Rocky Mountains, and floated by the Amazon<br>
or the Mississippi; numerous wrecks, remains of keels, or ships'<br>
bottoms, side-planks stove in, and so weighted with shells and<br>
barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface.  And time will<br>
one day justify Maury's other opinion, that these substances thus<br>
accumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water<br>
and will then form inexhaustible coal-mines--a precious reserve<br>
prepared by far-seeing Nature for the moment when men shall have<br>
exhausted the mines of continents.<br>
<br>
In the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed, I<br>
noticed some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long<br>
tentacles trailing after them, and medusae, green, red, and blue.<br>
<br>
All the day of the 22nd of February we passed in the Sargasso Sea,<br>
where such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant<br>
nourishment.  The next, the ocean had returned to its accustomed<br>
aspect.  From this time for nineteen days, from the 23rd of February to<br>
the 12th of March, the Nautilus kept in the middle of the Atlantic,<br>
carrying us at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twenty-four<br>
hours.  Captain Nemo evidently intended accomplishing his submarine<br>
programme, and I imagined that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn,<br>
to return to the Australian seas of the Pacific.  Ned Land had cause<br>
for fear.  In these large seas, void of islands, we could not attempt<br>
to leave the boat.  Nor had we any means of opposing Captain Nemo's<br>
will.  Our only course was to submit; but what we could neither gain by<br>
force nor cunning, I liked to think might be obtained by persuasion.<br>
This voyage ended, would he not consent to restore our liberty, under<br>
an oath never to reveal his existence?--an oath of honour which we<br>
should have religiously kept.  But we must consider that delicate<br>
question with the Captain.  But was I free to claim this liberty?  Had<br>
he not himself said from the beginning, in the firmest manner, that the<br>
secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board<br>
the Nautilus?  And would not my four months' silence appear to him a<br>
tacit acceptance of our situation?  And would not a return to the<br><a href="../site9/page9_3383.html">link4_text</a>
subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our<br>
projects, if at some future time a favourable opportunity offered to<br>
return to them?<br>
<br>
During the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind<br>
happened to signalise our voyage.  I saw little of the Captain; he was<br>
at work.  In the library I often found his books left open, especially<br>
those on natural history.  My work on submarine depths, conned over by<br>
him, was covered with marginal notes, often contradicting my theories<br>
and systems; but the Captain contented himself with thus purging my<br>
work; it was very rare for him to discuss it with me.  Sometimes I<br>
heard the melancholy tones of his organ; but only at night, in the<br>
midst of the deepest obscurity, when the Nautilus slept upon the<br>
deserted ocean.  During this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on<br>
the surface of the waves.  The sea seemed abandoned.  A few<br>
sailing-vessels, on the road to India, were making for the Cape of Good<br>
Hope.  One day we were followed by the boats of a whaler, who, no<br>
doubt, took us for some enormous whale of great price; but Captain Nemo<br>
did not wish the worthy fellows to lose their time and trouble, so<br>
ended the chase by plunging under the water.  Our navigation continued<br>
until the 13th of March; that day the Nautilus was employed intaking<br>
soundings, which greatly interested me.  We had then made about 13,000<br>
leagues since our departure from the high seas of the Pacific.  The<br>
bearings gave us 45° 37' S. lat., and 37° 53' W. long.  It was<br>
the same water in which Captain Denham of the Herald sounded 7,000<br>
fathoms without finding the bottom.  There, too, Lieutenant Parker, of<br>
the American frigate Congress, could not touch the bottom with 15,140<br>
fathoms.  Captain Nemo intended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a<br>
diagonal sufficiently lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at<br>
an angle of 45° with the water-line of the Nautilus.  Then the<br>
screw set to work at its maximum speed, its four blades beating the<br>
waves with in describable force.  Under this powerful pressure, the<br>
hull of the Nautilus quivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly<br>
under the water.<br>
<br>
At 7,000 fathoms I saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the<br>
waters; but these summits might belong to high mountains like the<br>
Himalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss<br>
remained incalculable.  The Nautilus descended still lower, in spite of<br>
the great pressure.  I felt the steel plates tremble at the fastenings<br>
of the bolts; its bars bent, its partitions groaned; the windows of the<br>
saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of the waters.  And this firm<br>
structure would doubtless have yielded, if, as its Captain had said, it<br>
had not been capable of resistance like a solid block.  We had attained<br>
a depth of 16,000 yards (four leagues), and the sides of the Nautilus<br>
then bore a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, that is to say, 3,200 lb.<br>
to each square two-fifths of an inch of its surface.<br>
<br>
"What a situation to be in!"  I exclaimed.  "To overrun these deep<br>
regions where man has never trod!  Look, Captain, look at these<br>
magnificent rocks, these uninhabited grottoes, these lowest receptacles<br>
of the globe, where life is no longer possible!  What unknown sights<br>
are here!  Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?"<br>
<br>
"Would you like to carry away more than the remembrance?" said Captain<br>
Nemo.<br>
<br>
"What do you mean by those words?"<br>
<br>
"I mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view<br>
of this submarine region."<br>
<br>
I had not time to express my surprise at this new proposition, when, at<br>
Captain Nemo's call, an objective was brought into the saloon.  Through<br>
the widely-opened panel, the liquid mass was bright with electricity,<br>
which was distributed with such uniformity that not a shadow, not a<br>
gradation, was to be seen in our manufactured light.  The Nautilus<br>
remained motionless, the force of its screw subdued by the inclination<br>
of its planes: the instrument was propped on the bottom of the oceanic<br>
site, and in a few seconds we had obtained a perfect negative.<br>
<br>
But, the operation being over, Captain Nemo said, "Let us go up; we<br>
must not abuse our position, nor expose the Nautilus too long to such<br>
great pressure."<br>
<br>
"Go up again!"  I exclaimed.<br>
<br>
"Hold well on."<br>
<br>
I had not time to understand why the Captain cautioned me thus, when I<br>
was thrown forward on to the carpet.  At a signal from the Captain, its<br>
screw was shipped, and its blades raised vertically; the Nautilus shot<br>
into the air like a balloon, rising with stunning rapidity, and cutting<br>
the mass of waters with a sonorous agitation.  Nothing was visible; and<br>
in four minutes it had shot through the four leagues which separated it<br>
from the ocean, and, after emerging like a flying-fish, fell, making<br>
the waves rebound to an enormous height.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XII<br>
<br>
CACHALOTS AND WHALES<br>
<br>
During the nights of the 13th and 14th of March, the Nautilus returned<br>
to its southerly course.  I fancied that, when on a level with Cape<br>
Horn, he would turn the helm westward, in order to beat the Pacific<br>
seas, and so complete the tour of the world.  He did nothing of the<br>
kind, but continued on his way to the southern regions.  Where was he<br>
going to?  To the pole?  It was madness!  I began to think that the<br>
Captain's temerity justified Ned Land's fears.  For some time past the<br>
Canadian had not spoken to me of his projects of flight; he was less<br>
communicative, almost silent.  I could see that this lengthened<br>
imprisonment was weighing upon him, and I felt that rage was burning<br>
within him.  When he met the Captain, his eyes lit up with suppressed<br>
anger; and I feared that his natural violence would lead him into some<br>
extreme.  That day, the 14th of March, Conseil and he came to me in my<br>
room.  I inquired the cause of their visit.<br>
<br>
"A simple question to ask you, sir," replied the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Speak, Ned."<br>
<br>
"How many men are there on board the Nautilus, do you think?"<br>
<br>
"I cannot tell, my friend."<br>
<br>
"I should say that its working does not require a large crew."<br>
<br>
"Certainly, under existing conditions, ten men, at the most, ought to<br>
be enough."<br>
<br>
"Well, why should there be any more?"<br>
<br>
"Why?"  I replied, looking fixedly at Ned Land, whose meaning was easy<br>
to guess.  "Because," I added, "if my surmises are correct, and if I<br>
have well understood the Captain's existence, the Nautilus is not only<br>
a vessel: it is also a place of refuge for those who, like its<br>
commander, have broken every tie upon earth."<br>
<br>
"Perhaps so," said Conseil; "but, in any case, the Nautilus can only<br>
contain a certain number of men.  Could not you, sir, estimate their<br>
maximum?"<br>
<br>
"How, Conseil?"<br>
<br>
"By calculation; given the size of the vessel, which you know, sir, and<br>
consequently the quantity of air it contains, knowing also how much<br>
each man expends at a breath, and comparing these results with the fact<br>
that the Nautilus is obliged to go to the surface every twenty-four<br>
hours."<br>
<br>
Conseil had not finished the sentence before I saw what he was driving<br>
at.<br>
<br>
"I understand," said I; "but that calculation, though simple enough,<br>
can give but a very uncertain result."<br>
<br>
"Never mind," said Ned Land urgently.<br>
<br>
"Here it is, then," said I. "In one hour each man consumes the oxygen<br>
contained in twenty gallons of air; and in twenty-four, that contained<br>
in 480 gallons.  We must, therefore find how many times 480 gallons of<br>
air the Nautilus contains."<br>
<br>
"Just so," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Or," I continued, "the size of the Nautilus being 1,500 tons; and one<br>
ton holding 200 gallons, it contains 300,000 gallons of air, which,<br>
divided by 480, gives a quotient of 625.  Which means to say, strictly<br>
speaking, that the air contained in the Nautilus would suffice for 625<br>
men for twenty-four hours."<br>
<br>
"Six hundred and twenty-five!" repeated Ned.<br>
<br>
"But remember that all of us, passengers, sailors, and officers<br>
included, would not form a tenth part of that number."<br>
<br>
"Still too many for three men," murmured Conseil.<br>
<br>
The Canadian shook his head, passed his hand across his forehead, and<br><a href="../site9/page4_5936.html">link5_text</a>
left the room without answering.<br>
<br>
"Will you allow me to make one observation, sir?" said Conseil.  "Poor<br>
Ned is longing for everything that he can not have.  His past life is<br>
always present to him; everything that we are forbidden he regrets.<br>
His head is full of old recollections.  And we must understand him.<br>
What has he to do here?  Nothing; he is not learned like you, sir; and<br>
has not the same taste for the beauties of the sea that we have.  He<br>
would risk everything to be able to go once more into a tavern in his<br>
own country."<br>
<br>
Certainly the monotony on board must seem intolerable to the Canadian,<br>
accustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity.  Events were<br>
rare which could rouse him to any show of spirit; but that day an event<br>
did happen which recalled the bright days of the harpooner.  About<br>
eleven in the morning, being on the surface of the ocean, the Nautilus<br>
fell in with a troop of whales--an encounter which did not astonish me,<br>
knowing that these creatures, hunted to death, had taken refuge in high<br>
latitudes.<br>
<br>
We were seated on the platform, with a quiet sea.  The month of October<br>
in those latitudes gave us some lovely autumnal days.  It was the<br>
Canadian--he could not be mistaken--who signalled a whale on the<br>
eastern horizon.  Looking attentively, one might see its black back<br>
rise and fall with the waves five miles from the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
"Ah!" exclaimed Ned Land, "if I was on board a whaler, now such a<br>
meeting would give me pleasure.  It is one of large size.  See with<br>
what strength its blow-holes throw up columns of air an steam!<br>
Confound it, why am I bound to these steel plates?"<br>
<br>
"What, Ned," said I, "you have not forgotten your old ideas of fishing?"<br>
<br>
"Can a whale-fisher ever forget his old trade, sir?  Can he ever tire<br>
of the emotions caused by such a chase?"<br>
<br>
"You have never fished in these seas, Ned?"<br>
<br>
"Never, sir; in the northern only, and as much in Behring as in Davis<br>
Straits."<br>
<br>
"Then the southern whale is still unknown to you.  It is the Greenland<br>
whale you have hunted up to this time, and that would not risk passing<br>
through the warm waters of the equator.  Whales are localised,<br>
according to their kinds, in certain seas which they never leave.  And<br>
if one of these creatures went from Behring to Davis Straits, it must<br>
be simply because there is a passage from one sea to the other, either<br>
on the American or the Asiatic side."<br>
<br>
"In that case, as I have never fished in these seas, I do not know the<br>
kind of whale frequenting them!"<br>
<br>
"I have told you, Ned."<br>
<br>
"A greater reason for making their acquaintance," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Look! look!" exclaimed the Canadian, "they approach: they aggravate<br>
me; they know that I cannot get at them!"<br>
<br>
Ned stamped his feet.  His hand trembled, as he grasped an imaginary<br>
harpoon.<br>
<br>
"Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas?" asked he.<br>
<br>
"Very nearly, Ned."<br>
<br>
"Because I have seen large whales, sir, whales measuring a hundred<br>
feet.  I have even been told that those of Hullamoch and Umgallick, of<br>
the Aleutian Islands, are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long."<br>
<br>
"That seems to me exaggeration. These creatures are only<br>
balaeaopterons, provided with dorsal fins; and, like the cachalots, are<br>
generally much smaller than the Greenland whale."<br>
<br>
"Ah!" exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes had never left the ocean,<br>
"they are coming nearer; they are in the same water as the Nautilus."<br>
<br>
Then, returning to the conversation, he said:<br>
<br>
"You spoke of the cachalot as a small creature.  I have heard of<br>
gigantic ones.  They are intelligent cetacea.  It is said of some that<br>
they cover themselves with seaweed and fucus, and then are taken for<br>
islands.  People encamp upon them, and settle there; lights a fire----"<br>
<br>
"And build houses," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Yes, joker," said Ned Land.  "And one fine day the creature plunges,<br>
carrying with it all the inhabitants to the bottom of the sea."<br>
<br>
"Something like the travels of Sinbad the Sailor," I replied, laughing.<br>
<br>
"Ah!" suddenly exclaimed Ned Land, "it is not one whale; there are<br>
ten--there are twenty--it is a whole troop!  And I not able to do<br>
anything! hands and feet tied!"<br>
<br>
"But, friend Ned," said Conseil, "why do you not ask Captain Nemo's<br>
permission to chase them?"<br>
<br>
Conseil had not finished his sentence when Ned Land had lowered himself<br>
through the panel to seek the Captain.  A few minutes afterwards the<br>
two appeared together on the platform.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo watched the troop of cetacea playing on the waters about a<br>
mile from the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
"They are southern whales," said he; "there goes the fortune of a whole<br>
fleet of whalers."<br>
<br>
"Well, sir," asked the Canadian, "can I not chase them, if only to<br>
remind me of my old trade of harpooner?"<br>
<br>
"And to what purpose?" replied Captain Nemo; "only to destroy!  We have<br>
nothing to do with the whale-oil on board."<br>
<br>
"But, sir," continued the Canadian, "in the Red Sea you allowed us to<br>
follow the dugong."<br>
<br>
"Then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew.  Here it would be<br>
killing for killing's sake.  I know that is a privilege reserved for<br>
man, but I do not approve of such murderous pastime.  In destroying the<br>
southern whale (like the Greenland whale, an inoffensive creature),<br>
your traders do a culpable action, Master Land.  They have already<br>
depopulated the whole of Baffin's Bay, and are annihilating a class of<br>
useful animals.  Leave the unfortunate cetacea alone.  They have plenty<br>
of natural enemies--cachalots, swordfish, and sawfish--without you<br>
troubling them."<br>
<br>
The Captain was right.  The barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these<br>
fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the<br>
ocean.  Ned Land whistled "Yankee-doodle" between his teeth, thrust his<br>
hands into his pockets, and turned his back upon us.  But Captain Nemo<br>
watched the troop of cetacea, and, addressing me, said:<br>
<br>
"I was right in saying that whales had natural enemies enough, without<br>
counting man.  These will have plenty to do before long.  Do you see,<br>
M. Aronnax, about eight miles to leeward, those blackish moving points?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, Captain," I replied.<br>
<br>
"Those are cachalots--terrible animals, which I have met in troops of<br>
two or three hundred.  As to those, they are cruel, mischievous<br>
creatures; they would be right in exterminating them."<br>
<br>
The Canadian turned quickly at the last words.<br>
<br>
"Well, Captain," said he, "it is still time, in the interest of the<br>
whales."<br>
<br>
"It is useless to expose one's self, Professor.  The Nautilus will<br>
disperse them.  It is armed with a steel spur as good as Master Land's<br>
harpoon, I imagine."<br>
<br>
The Canadian did not put himself out enough to shrug his shoulders.<br>
Attack cetacea with blows of a spur!  Who had ever heard of such a<br>
thing?<br>
<br>
"Wait, M. Aronnax," said Captain Nemo.  "We will show you something you<br>
have never yet seen.  We have no pity for these ferocious creatures.<br>
They are nothing but mouth and teeth."<br>
<br>
Mouth and teeth!  No one could better describe the macrocephalous<br>
cachalot, which is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long.  Its<br>
enormous head occupies one-third of its entire body.  Better armed than<br>
the whale, whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone, it is<br>
supplied with twenty-five large tusks, about eight inches long,<br>
cylindrical and conical at the top, each weighing two pounds.  It is in<br>
the upper part of this enormous head, in great cavities divided by<br>
cartilages, that is to be found from six to eight hundred pounds of<br>
that precious oil called spermaceti.  The cachalot is a disagreeable<br>
creature, more tadpole than fish, according to Fredol's description.<br>
It is badly formed, the whole of its left side being (if we may say<br><a href="../site1/page6_4408.html">link6_text</a>
it), a "failure," and being only able to see with its right eye.  But<br>
the formidable troop was nearing us.  They had seen the whales and were<br>
preparing to attack them.  One could judge beforehand that the<br>
cachalots would be victorious, not only because they were better built<br>
for attack than their inoffensive dversaries, but also because they<br>
could remain longer under water without coming to the surface.  There<br>
was only just time to go to the help of the whales.  The Nautilus went<br>
under water.  Conseil, Ned Land, and I took our places before the<br>
window in the saloon, and Captain Nemo joined the pilot in his cage to<br>
work his apparatus as an engine of destruction.  Soon I felt the<br>
beatings of the screw quicken, and our speed increased.  The battle<br>
between the cachalots and the whales had already begun when the<br>
Nautilus arrived.  They did not at first show any fear at the sight of<br>
this new monster joining in the conflict.  But they soon had to guard<br>
against its blows.  What a battle!  The Nautilus was nothing but a<br>
formidable harpoon, brandished by the hand of its Captain.  It hurled<br>
itself against the fleshy mass, passing through from one part to the<br>
other, leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal.  It could<br>
not feel the formidable blows from their tails upon its sides, nor the<br>
shock which it produced itself, much more.  One cachalot killed, it ran<br>
at the next, tacked on the spot that it might not miss its prey, going<br>
forwards and backwards, answering to its helm, plunging when the<br>
cetacean dived into the deep waters, coming up with it when it returned<br>
to the surface, striking it front or sideways, cutting or tearing in<br>
all directions and at any pace, piercing it with its terrible spur.<br>
What carnage!  What a noise on the surface of the waves!  What sharp<br>
hissing, and what snorting peculiar to these enraged animals!  In the<br>
midst of these waters, generally so peaceful, their tails made perfect<br>
billows.  For one hour this wholesale massacre continued, from which<br>
the cachalots could not escape.  Several times ten or twelve united<br>
tried to crush the Nautilus by their weight.  From the window we could<br>
see their enormous mouths, studded with tusks, and their formidable<br>
eyes.  Ned Land could not contain himself; he threatened and swore at<br>
them.  We could feel them clinging to our vessel like dogs worrying a<br>
wild boar in a copse.  But the Nautilus, working its screw, carried<br>
them here and there, or to the upper levels of the ocean, without<br>
caring for their enormous weight, nor the powerful strain on the<br>
vessel.  At length the mass of cachalots broke up, the waves became<br>
quiet, and I felt that we were rising to the surface.  The panel<br>
opened, and we hurried on to the platform.  The sea was covered with<br>
mutilated bodies.  A formidable explosion could not have divided and<br>
torn this fleshy mass with more violence.  We were floating amid<br>
gigantic bodies, bluish on the back and white underneath, covered with<br>
enormous protuberances.  Some terrified cachalots were flying towards<br>
the horizon.  The waves were dyed red for several miles, and the<br>
Nautilus floated in a sea of blood:  Captain Nemo joined us.<br>
<br>
"Well, Master Land?" said he.<br>
<br>
"Well, sir," replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat<br>
calmed; "it is a terrible spectacle, certainly.  But I am not a<br>
butcher.  I am a hunter, and I call this a butchery."<br>
<br>
"It is a massacre of mischievous creatures," replied the Captain; "and<br>
the Nautilus is not a butcher's knife."<br>
<br>
"I like my harpoon better," said the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Every one to his own," answered the Captain, looking fixedly at Ned<br>
Land.<br>
<br>
I feared he would commit some act of violence, which would end in sad<br>
consequences.  But his anger was turned by the sight of a whale which<br>
the Nautilus had just come up with.  The creature had not quite escaped<br>
from the cachalot's teeth.  I recognised the southern whale by its flat<br>
head, which is entirely black.  Anatomically, it is distinguished from<br>
the white whale and the North Cape whale by the seven cervical<br>
vertebrae, and it has two more ribs than its congeners.  The<br>
unfortunate cetacean was lying on its side, riddled with holes from the<br>
bites, and quite dead.  From its mutilated fin still hung a young whale<br>
which it could not save from the massacre.  Its open mouth let the<br>
water flow in and out, murmuring like the waves breaking on the shore.<br>
Captain Nemo steered close to the corpse of the creature.  Two of his<br>
men mounted its side, and I saw, not without surprise, that they were<br>
drawing from its breasts all the milk which they contained, that is to<br>
say, about two or three tons.  The Captain offered me a cup of the<br>
milk, which was still warm.  I could not help showing my repugnance to<br>
the drink; but he assured me that it was excellent, and not to be<br>
distinguished from cow's milk.  I tasted it, and was of his opinion.<br>
It was a useful reserve to us, for in the shape of salt butter or<br>
cheese it would form an agreeable variety from our ordinary food.  From<br>
that day I noticed with uneasiness that Ned Land's ill-will towards<br>
Captain Nemo increased, and I resolved to watch the Canadian's gestures<br>
closely.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIII<br>
<br>
THE ICEBERG<br>
<br>
The Nautilus was steadily pursuing its southerly course, following the<br>
fiftieth meridian with considerable speed.  Did he wish to reach the<br>
pole?  I did not think so, for every attempt to reach that point had<br>
hitherto failed.  Again, the season was far advanced, for in the<br>
Antarctic regions the 13th of March corresponds with the 13th of<br>
September of northern regions, which begin at the equinoctial season.<br>
On the 14th of March I saw floating ice in latitude 55°, merely<br>
pale bits of debris from twenty to twenty-five feet long, forming banks<br>
over which the sea curled.  The Nautilus remained on the surface of the<br>
ocean.  Ned Land, who had fished in the Arctic Seas, was familiar with<br>
its icebergs; but Conseil and I admired them for the first time.  In<br>
the atmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched a white dazzling<br>
band.  English whalers have given it the name of "ice blink."  However<br>
thick the clouds may be, it is always visible, and announces the<br>
presence of an ice pack or bank.  Accordingly, larger blocks soon<br>
appeared, whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog.  Some<br>
of these masses showed green veins, as if long undulating lines had<br>
been traced with sulphate of copper; others resembled enormous<br>
amethysts with the light shining through them.  Some reflected the<br>
light of day upon a thousand crystal facets.  Others shaded with vivid<br>
calcareous reflections resembled a perfect town of marble.  The more we<br>
neared the south the more these floating islands increased both in<br>
number and importance.<br>
<br>
At 60° lat. every pass had disappeared.  But, seeking carefully,<br>
Captain Nemo soon found a narrow opening, through which he boldly<br>
slipped, knowing, however, that it would close behind him.  Thus,<br>
guided by this clever hand, the Nautilus passed through all the ice<br>
with a precision which quite charmed Conseil; icebergs or mountains,<br>
ice-fields or smooth plains, seeming to have no limits, drift-ice or<br>
floating ice-packs, plains broken up, called palchs when they are<br>
circular, and streams when they are made up of long strips.  The<br>
temperature was very low; the thermometer exposed to the air marked 2<br>
deg. or 3° below zero, but we were warmly clad with fur, at the<br>
expense of the sea-bear and seal.  The interior of the Nautilus, warmed<br>
regularly by its electric apparatus, defied the most intense cold.<br>
Besides, it would only have been necessary to go some yards beneath the<br>
waves to find a more bearable temperature.  Two months earlier we<br>
should have had perpetual daylight in these latitudes; but already we<br>
had had three or four hours of night, and by and by there would be six<br>
months of darkness in these circumpolar regions.  On the 15th of March<br>
w were in the latitude of New Shetland and South Orkney.  The Captain<br>
told me that formerly numerous tribes of seals inhabited them; but that<br>
English and American whalers, in their rage for destruction, massacred<br>
both old and young; thus, where there was once life and animation, they<br>
had left silence and death.<br>
<br>
About eight o'clock on the morning of the 16th of March the Nautilus,<br>
following the fifty-fifth meridian, cut the Antarctic polar circle.<br>
Ice surrounded us on all sides, and closed the horizon.  But Captain<br>
Nemo went from one opening to another, still going higher.  I cannot<br>
express my astonishment at the beauties of these new regions.  The ice<br>
took most surprising forms.  Here the grouping formed an oriental town,<br>
with innumerable mosques and minarets; there a fallen city thrown to<br>
the earth, as it were, by some convulsion of nature.  The whole aspect<br>
was constantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the<br>
greyish fog amidst hurricanes of snow.  Detonations and falls were<br>
heard on all sides, great overthrows of icebergs, which altered the<br>
whole landscape like a diorama.  Often seeing no exit, I thought we<br>
were definitely prisoners; but, instinct guiding him at the slightest<br>
indication, Captain Nemo would discover a new pass.  He was never<br>
mistaken when he saw the thin threads of bluish water trickling along<br>
the ice-fields; and I had no doubt that he had already ventured into<br>
the midst of these Antarctic seas before.  On the 16th of March,<br>
however, the ice-fields absolutely blocked our road.  It was not the<br>
iceberg itself, as yet, but vast fields cemented by the cold.  But this<br>
obstacle could not stop Captain Nemo: he hurled himself against it with<br>
frightful violence.  The Nautilus entered the brittle mass like a<br>
wedge, and split it with frightful crackings.  It was the battering ram<br>
of the ancients hurled by infinite strength.  The ice, thrown high in<br>
the air, fell like hail around us.  By its own power of impulsion our<br>
apparatus made a canal for itself; some times carried away by its own<br>
impetus, it lodged on the ice-field, crushing it with its weight, and<br>
sometimes buried beneath it, dividing it by a simple pitching movement,<br>
producing large rents in it.  Violent gales assailed us at this time,<br>
accompanied by thick fogs, through which, from one end of the platform<br>
to the other, we could see nothing.  The wind blew sharply from all<br>
parts of the compass, and the snow lay in such hard heaps that we had<br>
to break it with blows of a pickaxe.  The temperature was always at 5<br>
deg. below zero; every outward part of the Nautilus was covered with<br><a href="../site9/page7_7095.html">link7_text</a>
ice.  A rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up<br>
gorges.  A vessel without sails, with electricity for its motive power,<br>
and wanting no coal, could alone brave such high latitudes.  At length,<br>
on the 18th of March, after many useless assaults, the Nautilus was<br>
positively blocked.  It was no longer either streams, packs, or<br>
ice-fields, but an interminable and immovable barrier, formed by<br>
mountains soldered together.<br>
<br>
"An iceberg!" said the Canadian to me.<br>
<br>
I knew that to Ned Land, as well as to all other navigators who had<br>
preceded us, this was an inevitable obstacle.  The sun appearing for an<br>
instant at noon, Captain Nemo took an observation as near as possible,<br>
which gave our situation at 51° 30' long. and 67° 39' of S.<br>
lat.  We had advanced one degree more in this Antarctic region.  Of the<br>
liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse.  Under the<br>
spur of the Nautilus lay stretched a vast plain, entangled with<br>
confused blocks.  Here and there sharp points and slender needles<br>
rising to a height of 200 feet; further on a steep shore, hewn as it<br>
were with an axe and clothed with greyish tints; huge mirrors,<br>
reflecting a few rays of sunshine, half drowned in the fog.  And over<br>
this desolate face of nature a stern silence reigned, scarcely broken<br>
by the flapping of the wings of petrels and puffins.  Everything was<br>
frozen--even the noise.  The Nautilus was then obliged to stop in its<br>
adventurous course amid these fields of ice.  In spite of our efforts,<br>
in spite of the powerful means employed to break up the ice, the<br>
Nautilus remained immovable.  Generally, when we can proceed no<br>
further, we have return still open to us; but here return was as<br>
impossible as advance, for every pass had closed behind us; and for the<br>
few moments when we were stationary, we were likely to be entirely<br>
blocked, which did indeed happen about two o'clock in the afternoon,<br>
the fresh ice forming around its sides with astonishing rapidity.  I<br>
was obliged to admit that Captain Nemo was more than imprudent.  I was<br>
on the platform at that moment.  The Captain had been observing our<br>
situation for some time past, when he said to me:<br>
<br>
"Well, sir, what do you think of this?"<br>
<br>
"I think that we are caught, Captain."<br>
<br>
"So, M. Aronnax, you really think that the Nautilus cannot disengage<br>
itself?"<br>
<br>
"With difficulty, Captain; for the season is already too far advanced<br>
for you to reckon on the breaking of the ice."<br>
<br>
"Ah! sir," said Captain Nemo, in an ironical tone, "you will always be<br>
the same.  You see nothing but difficulties and obstacles.  I affirm<br>
that not only can the Nautilus disengage itself, but also that it can<br>
go further still."<br>
<br>
"Further to the South?"  I asked, looking at the Captain.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir; it shall go to the pole."<br>
<br>
"To the pole!"  I exclaimed, unable to repress a gesture of incredulity.<br>
<br>
"Yes," replied the Captain, coldly, "to the Antarctic pole--to that<br>
unknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe.  You<br>
know whether I can do as I please with the Nautilus!"<br>
<br>
Yes, I knew that.  I knew that this man was bold, even to rashness.<br>
But to conquer those obstacles which bristled round the South Pole,<br>
rendering it more inaccessible than the North, which had not yet been<br>
reached by the boldest navigators--was it not a mad enterprise, one<br>
which only a maniac would have conceived?  It then came into my head to<br>
ask Captain Nemo if he had ever discovered that pole which had never<br>
yet been trodden by a human creature?<br>
<br>
"No, sir," he replied; "but we will discover it together.  Where others<br>
have failed, I will not fail.  I have never yet led my Nautilus so far<br>
into southern seas; but, I repeat, it shall go further yet."<br>
<br>
"I can well believe you, Captain," said I, in a slightly ironical tone.<br>
"I believe you!  Let us go ahead!  There are no obstacles for us!  Let<br>
us smash this iceberg!  Let us blow it up; and, if it resists, let us<br>
give the Nautilus wings to fly over it!"<br>
<br>
"Over it, sir!" said Captain Nemo, quietly; "no, not over it, but under<br>
it!"<br>
<br>
"Under it!"  I exclaimed, a sudden idea of the Captain's projects<br>
flashing upon my mind.  I understood; the wonderful qualities of the<br>
Nautilus were going to serve us in this superhuman enterprise.<br>
<br>
"I see we are beginning to understand one another, sir," said the<br>
Captain, half smiling.  "You begin to see the possibility--I should say<br>
the success--of this attempt.  That which is impossible for an ordinary<br>
vessel is easy to the Nautilus.  If a continent lies before the pole,<br>
it must stop before the continent; but if, on the contrary, the pole is<br>
washed by open sea, it will go even to the pole."<br>
<br>
"Certainly," said I, carried away by the Captain's reasoning; "if the<br>
surface of the sea is solidified by the ice, the lower depths are free<br>
by the Providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the<br>
waters of the ocean one degee higher than freezing-point; and, if I am<br>
not mistaken, the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is<br>
as one to four to that which is below."<br>
<br>
"Very nearly, sir; for one foot of iceberg above the sea there are<br>
three below it.  If these ice mountains are not more than 300 feet<br>
above the surface, they are not more than 900 beneath.  And what are<br>
900 feet to the Nautilus?"<br>
<br>
"Nothing, sir."<br>
<br>
"It could even seek at greater depths that uniform temperature of<br>
sea-water, and there brave with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of<br>
surface cold."<br>
<br>
"Just so, sir--just so," I replied, getting animated.<br>
<br>
"The only difficulty," continued Captain Nemo, "is that of remaining<br>
several days without renewing our provision of air."<br>
<br>
"Is that all?  The Nautilus has vast reservoirs; we can fill them, and<br>
they will supply us with all the oxygen we want."<br>
<br>
"Well thought of, M. Aronnax," replied the Captain, smiling.  "But, not<br>
wishing you to accuse me of rashness, I will first give you all my<br>
objections."<br>
<br>
"Have you any more to make?"<br>
<br>
"Only one.  It is possible, if the sea exists at the South Pole, that<br>
it may be covered; and, consequently, we shall be unable to come to the<br>
surface."<br>
<br>
"Good, sir! but do you forget that the Nautilus is armed with a<br>
powerful spur, and could we not send it diagonally against these fields<br>
of ice, which would open at the shocks."<br>
<br>
"Ah! sir, you are full of ideas to-day."<br>
<br>
"Besides, Captain," I added, enthusiastically, "why should we not find<br>
the sea open at the South Pole as well as at the North?  The frozen<br>
poles of the earth do not coincide, either in the southern or in the<br>
northern regions; and, until it is proved to the contrary, we may<br>
suppose either a continent or an ocean free from ice at these two<br>
points of the globe."<br>
<br>
"I think so too, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo.  "I only wish you<br>
to observe that, after having made so many objections to my project,<br>
you are now crushing me with arguments in its favour!"<br>
<br>
The preparations for this audacious attempt now began.  The powerful<br>
pumps of the Nautilus were working air into the reservoirs and storing<br>
it at high pressure.  About four o'clock, Captain Nemo announced the<br>
closing of the panels on the platform.  I threw one last look at the<br>
massive iceberg which we were going to cross.  The weather was clear,<br>
the atmosphere pure enough, the cold very great, being 12° below<br>
zero; but, the wind having gone down, this temperature was not so<br>
unbearable.  About ten men mounted the sides of the Nautilus, armed<br>
with pickaxes to break the ice around the vessel, which was soon free.<br>
The operation was quickly performed, for the fresh ice was still very<br>
thin.  We all went below.  The usual reservoirs were filled with the<br>
newly-liberated water, and the Nautilus soon descended.  I had taken my<br>
place with Conseil in the saloon; through the open window we could see<br>
the lower beds of the Southern Ocean.  The thermometer went up, the<br>
needle of the compass deviated on the dial.  At about 900 feet, as<br>
Captain Nemo had foreseen, we were floating beneath the undulating<br>
bottom of the iceberg.  But the Nautilus went lower still--it went to<br>
the depth of four hundred fathoms.  The temperature of the water at the<br>
surface showed twelve degrees, it was now only ten; we had gained two.<br>
I need not say the temperature of the Nautilus was raised by its<br>
heating apparatus to a much higher degree; every manoeuvre was<br>
accomplished with wonderful precision.<br>
<br>
"We shall pass it, if you please, sir," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"I believe we shall," I said, in a tone of firm conviction.<br><a href="../site0/page2_2216.html">link8_text</a>
<br>
In this open sea, the Nautilus had taken its course direct to the pole,<br>
without leaving the fifty-second meridian.  From 67° 30' to 90<br>
deg., twenty-two degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel;<br>
that is, about five hundred leagues.  The Nautilus kept up a mean speed<br>
of twenty-six miles an hour--the speed of an express train.  If that<br>
was kept up, in forty hours we should reach the pole.<br>
<br>
For a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at the<br>
window.  The sea was lit with the electric lantern; but it was<br>
deserted; fishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters; they only<br>
found there a passage to take them from the Antarctic Ocean to the open<br>
polar sea.  Our pace was rapid; we could feel it by the quivering of<br>
the long steel body.  About two in the morning I took some hours'<br>
repose, and Conseil did the same.  In crossing the waist I did not meet<br>
Captain Nemo: I supposed him to be in the pilot's cage.  The next<br>
morning, the 19th of March, I took my post once more in the saloon.<br>
The electric log told me that the speed of the Nautilus had been<br>
slackened.  It was then going towards the surface; but prudently<br>
emptying its reservoirs very slowly.  My heart beat fast.  Were we<br>
going to emerge and regain the open polar atmosphere?  No!  A shock<br>
told me that the Nautilus had struck the bottom of the iceberg, still<br>
very thick, judging from the deadened sound.  We had in deed "struck,"<br>
to use a sea expression, but in an inverse sense, and at a thousand<br>
feet deep.  This would give three thousand feet of ice above us; one<br>
thousand being above the water-mark. The iceberg was then higher than<br>
at its borders--not a very reassuring fact.  Several times that day the<br>
Nautilus tried again, and every time it struck the wall which lay like<br>
a ceiling above it.  Sometimes it met with but 900 yards, only 200 of<br>
which rose above the surface.  It was twice the height it was when the<br>
Nautilus had gone under the waves.  I carefully noted the different<br>
depths, and thus obtained a submarine profile of the chain as it was<br>
developed under the water.  That night no change had taken place in our<br>
situation.  Still ice between four and five hundred yards in depth!  It<br>
was evidently diminishing, but, still, what a thickness between us and<br>
the surface of the ocean!  It was then eight.  According to the daily<br>
custom on board the Nautilus, its air should have been renewed four<br>
hours ago; but I did not suffer much, although Captain Nemo had not yet<br>
made any demand upon his reserve of oxygen.  My sleep was painful that<br>
night; hope and fear besieged me by turns: I rose several times.  The<br>
groping of the Nautilus continued.  About three in the morning, I<br>
noticed that the lower surface of the iceberg was only about fifty feet<br>
deep.  One hundred and fifty feet now separated us from the surface of<br>
the waters.  The iceberg was by degrees becoming an ice-field, the<br>
mountain a plain.  My eyes never left the manometer.  We were still<br>
rising diagonally to the surface, which sparkled under the electric<br>
rays.  The iceberg was stretching both above and beneath into<br>
lengthening slopes; mile after mile it was getting thinner.  At length,<br>
at six in the morning of that memorable day, the 19th of March, the<br>
door of the saloon opened, and Captain Nemo appeared.<br>
<br>
"The sea is open!!" was all he said.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIV<br>
<br>
THE SOUTH POLE<br>
<br>
I rushed on to the platform.  Yes! the open sea, with but a few<br>
scattered pieces of ice and moving icebergs--a long stretch of sea; a<br>
world of birds in the air, and myriads of fishes under those waters,<br>
which varied from intense blue to olive green, according to the bottom.<br>
The thermometer marked 3° C. above zero.  It was comparatively<br>
spring, shut up as we were behind this iceberg, whose lengthened mass<br>
was dimly seen on our northern horizon.<br>
<br>
"Are we at the pole?"  I asked the Captain, with a beting heart.<br>
<br>
"I do not know," he replied.  "At noon I will take our bearings."<br>
<br>
"But will the sun show himself through this fog?" said I, looking at<br>
the leaden sky.<br>
<br>
"However little it shows, it will be enough," replied the Captain.<br>
<br>
About ten miles south a solitary island rose to a height of one hundred<br>
and four yards.  We made for it, but carefully, for the sea might be<br>
strewn with banks.  One hour afterwards we had reached it, two hours<br>
later we had made the round of it.  It measured four or five miles in<br>
circumference.  A narrow canal separated it from a considerable stretch<br>
of land, perhaps a continent, for we could not see its limits.  The<br>
existence of this land seemed to give some colour to Maury's theory.<br>
The ingenious American has remarked that, between the South Pole and<br>
the sixtieth parallel, the sea is covered with floating ice of enormous<br>
size, which is never met with in the North Atlantic.  From this fact he<br>
has drawn the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle encloses<br>
considerable continents, as icebergs cannot form in open sea, but only<br>
on the coasts.  According to these calculations, the mass of ice<br>
surrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap, the circumference of<br>
which must be, at least, 2,500 miles.  But the Nautilus, for fear of<br>
running aground, had stopped about three cable-lengths from a strand<br>
over which reared a superb heap of rocks.  The boat was launched; the<br>
Captain, two of his men, bearing instruments, Conseil, and myself were<br>
in it.  It was ten in the morning.  I had not seen Ned Land.  Doubtless<br>
the Canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the South Pole.  A<br>
few strokes of the oar brought us to the sand, where we ran ashore.<br>
Conseil was going to jump on to the land, when I held him back.<br>
<br>
"Sir," said I to Captain Nemo, "to you belongs the honour of first<br>
setting foot on this land."<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir," said the Captain, "and if I do not hesitate to tread this<br>
South Pole, it is because, up to this time, no human being has left a<br>
trace there."<br>
<br>
Saying this, he jumped lightly on to the sand.  His heart beat with<br>
emotion.  He climbed a rock, sloping to a little promontory, and there,<br>
with his arms crossed, mute and motionless, and with an eager look, he<br>
seemed to take possession of these southern regions.  After five<br>
minutes passed in this ecstasy, he turned to us.<br>
<br>
"When you like, sir."<br>
<br>
I landed, followed by Conseil, leaving the two men in the boat.  For a<br>
long way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone, something like<br>
crushed brick, scoriae, streams of lava, and pumice-stones. One could<br>
not mistake its volcanic origin.  In some parts, slight curls of smoke<br>
emitted a sulphurous smell, proving that the internal fires had lost<br>
nothing of their expansive powers, though, having climbed a high<br>
acclivity, I could see no volcano for a radius of several miles.  We<br>
know that in those Antarctic countries, James Ross found two craters,<br>
the Erebus and Terror, in full activity, on the 167th meridian,<br>
latitude 77° 32'. The vegetation of this desolate continent seemed<br>
to me much restricted.  Some lichens lay upon the black rocks; some<br>
microscopic plants, rudimentary diatomas, a kind of cells placed<br>
between two quartz shells; long purple and scarlet weed, supported on<br>
little swimming bladders, which the breaking of the waves brought to<br>
the shore.  These constituted the meagre flora of this region.  The<br>
shore was strewn with molluscs, little mussels, and limpets.  I also<br>
saw myriads of northern clios, one-and-a-quarter inches long, of which<br>
a whale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful; and some perfect<br>
sea-butterflies, animating the waters on the skirts of the shore.<br>
<br>
There appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs, of the kind<br>
which, according to James Ross, live in the Antarctic seas to the depth<br>
of more than 1,000 yards.  Then there were little kingfishers and<br>
starfish studding the soil.  But where life abounded most was in the<br>
air.  There thousands of birds fluttered and flew of all kinds,<br>
deafening us with their cries; others crowded the rock, looking at us<br>
as we passed by without fear, and pressing familiarly close by our<br>
feet.  There were penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as<br>
they are on the ground; they were uttering harsh cries, a large<br>
assembly, sober in gesture, but extravagant in clamour.  Albatrosses<br>
passed in the air, the expanse of their wings being at least four yards<br>
and a half, and justly called the vultures of the ocean; some gigantic<br>
petrels, and some damiers, a kind of small duck, the underpart of whose<br>
body is black and white; then there were a whole series of petrels,<br>
some whitish, with brown-bordered wings, others blue, peculiar to the<br>
Antarctic seas, and so oily, as I told Conseil, that the inhabitants of<br>
the Ferroe Islands had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a<br>
wick in.<br>
<br>
"A little more," said Conseil, "and they would be perfect lamps!  After<br>
that, we cannot expect Nature to have previously furnished them with<br>
wicks!"<br>
<br>
About half a mile farther on the soil was riddled with ruffs' nests, a<br>
sort of laying-ground, out of which many birds were issuing.  Captain<br>
Nemo had some hundreds hunted.  They uttered a cry like the braying of<br>
an ass, were about the size of a goose, slate-colour on the body, white<br>
beneath, with a yellow line round their throats; they allowed<br>
themselves to be killed with a stone, never trying to escape.  But the<br>
fog did not lift, and at eleven the sun had not yet shown itself.  Its<br>
absence made me uneasy.  Without it no observations were possible.<br>
How, then, could we decide whether we had reached the pole?  When I<br>
rejoined Captain Nemo, I found him leaning on a piece of rock, silently<br>
watching the sky.  He seemed impatient and vexed.  But what was to be<br>
done?  This rash and powerful man could not command the sun as he did<br>
the sea.  Noon arrived without the orb of day showing itself for an<br>
instant.  We could not even tell its position behind the curtain of<br><a href="../site9/page5_8391.html">link9_text</a>
fog; and soon the fog turned to snow.<br>
<br>
"Till to-morrow," said the Captain, quietly, and we returned to the<br>
Nautilus amid these atmospheric disturbances.<br>
<br>
The tempest of snow continued till the next day.  It was impossible to<br>
remain on the platform.  From the saloon, where I was taking notes of<br>
incidents happening during this excursion to the polar continent, I<br>
could hear the cries of petrels and albatrosses sporting in the midst<br>
of this violent storm.  The Nautilus did not remain motionless, but<br>
skirted the coast, advancing ten miles more to the south in the<br>
half-light left by the sun as it skirted the edge of the horizon.  The<br>
next day, the 20th of March, the snow had ceased.  The cold was a<br>
little greater, the thermometer showing 2° below zero.  The fog<br>
was rising, and I hoped that that day our observations might be taken.<br>
Captain Nemo not having yet appeared, the boat took Conseil and myself<br>
to land.  The soil was still of the same volcanic nature; everywhere<br>
were traces of lava, scoriae, and basalt; but the crater which had<br>
vomited them I could not see.  Here, as lower down, this continent was<br>
alive with myriads of birds.  But their rule was now divided with large<br>
troops of sea-mammals, looking at us with their soft eyes.  There were<br>
several kinds of seals, some stretched on the earth, some on flakes of<br>
ice, many going in and out of the sea.  They did not flee at our<br>
approach, never having had anything to do with man; and I reckoned that<br>
there were provisions there for hundreds of vessels.<br>
<br>
"Sir,"said Conseil, "will you tell me the names of these creatures?"<br>
<br>
"They are seals and morses."<br>
<br>
It was now eight in the morning.  Four hours remained to us before the<br>
sun could be observed with advantage.  I directed our steps towards a<br>
vast bay cut in the steep granite shore.  There, I can aver that earth<br>
and ice were lost to sight by the numbers of sea-mammals covering them,<br>
and I involuntarily sought for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd<br>
who watched these immense flocks of Neptune.  There were more seals<br>
than anything else, forming distinct groups, male and female, the<br>
father watching over his family, the mother suckling her little ones,<br>
some already strong enough to go a few steps.  When they wished to<br>
change their place, they took little jumps, made by the contraction of<br>
their bodies, and helped awkwardly enough by their imperfect fin,<br>
which, as with the lamantin, their cousins, forms a perfect forearm.  I<br>
should say that, in the water, which is their element--the spine of<br>
these creatures is flexible; with smooth and close skin and webbed<br>
feet--they swim admirably.  In resting on the earth they take the most<br>
graceful attitudes.  Thus the ancients, observing their soft and<br>
expressive looks, which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look<br>
a woman can give, their clear voluptuous eyes, their charming<br>
positions, and the poetry of their manners, metamorphosed them, the<br>
male into a triton and the female into a mermaid.  I made Conseil<br>
notice the considerable development of the lobes of the brain in these<br>
interesting cetaceans.  No mammal, except man, has such a quantity of<br>
brain matter; they are also capable of receiving a certain amount of<br>
education, are easily domesticated, and I think, with other<br>
naturalists, that if properly taught they would be of great service as<br>
fishing-dogs.  The greater part of them slept on the rocks or on the<br>
sand.  Amongst these seals, properly so called, which have no external<br>
ears (in which they differ from the otter, whose ears are prominent), I<br>
noticed several varieties of seals about three yards long, with a white<br>
coat, bulldog heads, armed with teeth in both jaws, four incisors at<br>
the top and four at the bottom, and two large canine teeth in the shape<br>
of a fleur-de-lis. Amongst them glided sea-elephants, a kind of seal,<br>
with short, flexible trunks.  The giants of this species measured<br>
twenty feet round and ten yards and a half in length; but they did not<br>
move as we approached.<br>
<br>
"These creatures are not dangerous?" asked Conseil.<br>
<br>
"No; not unless you attack them.  When they have to defend their young<br>
their rage is terrible, and it is not uncommon for them to break the<br>
fishing-boats to pieces."<br>
<br>
"They are quite right," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"I do not say they are not."<br>
<br>
Two miles farther on we were stopped by the promontory which shelters<br>
the bay from the southerly winds.  Beyond it we heard loud bellowings<br>
such as a troop of ruminants would produce.<br>
<br>
"Good!" said Conseil; "a concert of bulls!"<br>
<br>
"No; a concert of morses."<br>
<br>
"They are fighting!"<br>
<br>
"They are either fighting or playing."<br>
<br>
We now began to climb the blackish rocks, amid unforeseen stumbles, and<br>
over stones which the ice made slippery.  More than once I rolled over<br>
at the expense of my loins.  Conseil, more prudent or more steady, did<br>
not stumble, and helped me up, saying:<br>
<br>
"If, sir, you would have the kindness to take wider steps, you would<br>
preserve your equilibrium better."<br>
<br>
Arrived at the upper ridge of the promontory, I saw a vast white plain<br>
covered with morses.  They were playing amongst themselves, and what we<br>
heard were bellowings of pleasure, not of anger.<br>
<br>
As I passed these curious animals I could examine them leisurely, for<br>
they did not move.  Their skins were thick and rugged, of a yellowish<br>
tint, approaching to red; their hair was short and scant.  Some of them<br>
were four yards and a quarter long.  Quieter and less timid than their<br>
cousins of the north, they did not, like them, place sentinels round<br>
the outskirts of their encampment.  After examining this city of<br>
morses, I began to think of returning.  It was eleven o'clock, and, if<br>
Captain Nemo found the conditions favourable for observations, I wished<br>
to be present at the operation.  We followed a narrow pathway running<br>
along the summit of the steep shore.  At half-past eleven we had<br>
reached the place where we landed.  The boat had run aground, bringing<br>
the Captain.  I saw him standing on a block of basalt, his instruments<br>
near him, his eyes fixed on the northern horizon, near which the sun<br>
was then describing a lengthened curve.  I took my place beside him,<br>
and waited without speaking.  Noon arrived, and, as before, the sun did<br>
not appear.  It was a fatality.  Observations were still wanting.  If<br>
not accomplished to-morrow, we must give up all idea of taking any.  We<br>
were indeed exactly at the 20th of March.  To-morrow, the 21st, would<br>
be the equinox; the sun would disappear behind the horizon for six<br>
months, and with its disappearance the long polar night would begin.<br>
Since the September equinox it had emerged from the northern horizon,<br>
rising by lengthened spirals up to the 21st of December.  At this<br>
period, the summer solstice of the northern regions, it had begun to<br>
descend; and to-morrow was to shed its last rays upon them.  I<br>
communicated my fears and observations to Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
"You are right, M. Aronnax," said he; "if to-morrow I cannot take the<br>
altitude of the sun, I shall not be able to do it for six months.  But<br>
precisely because chance has led me into these seas on the 21st of<br>
March, my bearings will be easy to take, if at twelve we can see the<br>
sun."<br>
<br>
"Why, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"Because then the orb of day described such lengthened curves that it<br>
is difficult to measure exactly its height above the horizon, and grave<br>
errors may be made with instruments."<br>
<br>
"What will you do then?"<br>
<br>
"I shall only use my chronometer," replied Captain Nemo.  "If<br>
to-morrow, the 21st of March, the disc of the sun, allowing for<br>
refraction, is exactly cut by the northern horizon, it will show that I<br>
am at the South Pole."<br>
<br>
"Just so," said I. "But this statement is not mathematically correct,<br>
because the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon."<br>
<br>
"Very likely, sir; but the error will not be a hundred yards and we do<br>
not want more.  Till to-morrow, then!"<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo returned on board.  Conseil and I remained to survey the<br>
shore, observing and studying until five o'clock. Then I went to bed,<br>
not, however, without invoking, like the Indian, the favour of the<br>
radiant orb.  The next day, the 21st of March, at five in the morning,<br>
I mounted the platform.  I found Captain Nemo there.<br>
<br>
"The weather is lightening a little," said he.  "I have some hope.<br>
After breakfast we will go on shore and choose a post for observation."<br>
<br>
That point settled, I sought Ned Land.  I wanted to take him with me.<br>
But the obstinate Canadian refused, and I saw that his taciturnity and<br>
his bad humour grew day by day.  After all, I was not sorry for his<br>
obstinacy under the circumstances.  Indeed, there were too many seals<br>
on shore, and we ought not to lay such temptation in this unreflecting<br>
fisherman's way.  Breakfast over, we went on shore.  The Nautilus had<br>
gone some miles further up in the night.  It was a whole league from<br>
the coast, above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards<br>
high.  The boat took with me Captain Nemo, two men of the crew, and the<br>
instruments, which consisted of a chronometer, a telescope, an a<br>
barometer.  While crossing, I saw numerous whales belonging to the<br><a href="../site9/page2_5329.html">link10_text</a>
