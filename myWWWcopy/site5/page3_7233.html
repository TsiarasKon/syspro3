Sea to the Mediterranean, from the sole cause of difference of level.<br>
I caught a large number of fishes in the neighbourhood of Suez.  I<br>
passed a copper ring through their tails, and threw them back into the<br>
sea.  Some months later, on the coast of Syria, I caught some of my<br>
fish ornamented with the ring.  Thus the communication between the two<br>
was proved.  I then sought for it with my Nautilus; I discovered it,<br>
ventured into it, and before long, sir, you too will have passed<br>
through my Arabian tunnel!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V<br>
<br>
THE ARABIAN TUNNEL<br>
<br>
That same evening, in 21Â° 30' N. lat., the Nautilus floated on the<br>
surface of the sea, approaching the Arabian coast.  I saw Djeddah, the<br>
most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India.  I<br>
distinguished clearly enough its buildings, the vessels anchored at the<br>
quays, and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the<br>
roads.  The sun, rather low on the horizon, struck full on the houses<br>
of the town, bringing out their whiteness.  Outside, some wooden<br>
cabins, and some made of reeds, showed the quarter inhabited by the<br>
Bedouins.  Soon Djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night,<br>
and the Nautilus found herself under water slightly phosphorescent.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 10th of February, we sighted several ships running to<br>
windward.  The Nautilus returned to its submarine navigation; but at<br>
noon, when her bearings were taken, the sea being deserted, she rose<br>
again to her waterline.<br>
<br>
Accompanied by Ned and Conseil, I seated myself on the platform.  The<br>
coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a<br>
damp fog.<br>
<br>
We were leaning on the sides of the pinnace, talking of one thing and<br>
another, when Ned Land, stretching out his hand towards a spot on the<br>
sea, said:<br>
<br>
"Do you see anything there, sir?"<br>
<br>
"No, Ned," I replied; "but I have not your eyes, you know."<br>
<br>
"Look well," said Ned, "there, on the starboard beam, about the height<br>
of the lantern!  Do you not see a mass which seems to move?"<br>
<br>
"Certainly," said I, after close attention; "I see something like a<br>
long black body on the top of the water."<br>
<br>
And certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile<br>
from us.  It looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea.<br>
It was a gigantic dugong!<br>
<br>
Ned Land looked eagerly.  His eyes shone with covetousness at the sight<br>
of the animal.  His hand seemed ready to harpoon it.  One would have<br>
thought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and<br>
attack it in its element.<br>
<br>
At this instant Captain Nemo appeared on the platform.  He saw the<br>
dugong, understood the Canadian's attitude, and, addressing him, said:<br>
<br>
"If you held a harpoon just now, Master Land, would it not burn your<br>
hand?"<br>
<br>
"Just so, sir."<br>
<br>
"And you would not be sorry to go back, for one day, to your trade of a<br>
fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have<br>
already killed?"<br>
<br>
"I should not, sir."<br>
<br>
"Well, you can try."<br>
<br>
"Thank you, sir," said Ned Land, his eyes flaming.<br>
<br>
"Only," continued the Captain, "I advise you for your own sake not to<br>
miss the creature."<br>
<br>
"Is the dugong dangerous to attack?"  I asked, in spite of the<br>
Canadian's shrug of the shoulders.<br>
<br>
"Yes," replied the Captain; "sometimes the animal turns upon its<br>
assailants and overturns their boat.  But for Master Land this danger<br>
is not to be feared.  His eye is prompt, his arm sure."<br>
<br>
At this moment seven men of the crew, mute and immovable as ever,<br>
mounted the platform.  One carried a harpoon and a line similar to<br>
those employed in catching whales.  The pinnace was lifted from the<br>
bridge, pulled from its socket, and let down into the sea.  Six oarsmen<br>
took their seats, and the coxswain went to the tiller.  Ned, Conseil,<br>
and I went to the back of the boat.<br>
<br>
"You are not coming, Captain?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"No, sir; but I wish you good sport."<br>
<br>
The boat put off, and, lifted by the six rowers, drew rapidly towards<br>
the dugong, which floated about two miles from the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
Arrived some cables-length from the cetacean, the speed slackened, and<br>
the oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters.  Ned Land, harpoon<br><a href="../site9/page7_7095.html">link1_text</a>
in hand, stood in the fore part of the boat.  The harpoon used for<br>
striking the whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs<br>
out rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him.  But here the<br>
cord was not more than ten fathoms long, and the extremity was attached<br>
to a small barrel which, by floating, was to show the course the dugong<br>
took under the water.<br>
<br>
I stood and carefully watched the Canadian's adversary.  This dugong,<br>
which also bears the name of the halicore, closely resembles the<br>
manatee; its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail, and its<br>
lateral fins in perfect fingers.  Its difference from the manatee<br>
consisted in its upper jaw, which was armed with two long and pointed<br>
teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks.<br>
<br>
This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal<br>
dimensions; it was more than seven yards long.  It did not move, and<br>
seemed to be sleeping on the waves, which circumstance made it easier<br>
to capture.<br>
<br>
The boat approached within six yards of the animal.  The oars rested on<br>
the rowlocks.  I half rose.  Ned Land, his body thrown a little back,<br>
brandished the harpoon in his experienced hand.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a hissing noise was heard, and the dugong disappeared.  The<br>
harpoon, although thrown with great force; had apparently only struck<br>
the water.<br>
<br>
"Curse it!" exclaimed the Canadian furiously; "I have missed it!"<br>
<br>
"No," said I; "the creature is wounded--look at the blood; but your<br>
weapon has not stuck in his body."<br>
<br>
"My harpoon! my harpoon!" cried Ned Land.<br>
<br>
The sailors rowed on, and the coxswain made for the floating barrel.<br>
The harpoon regained, we followed in pursuit of the animal.<br>
<br>
The latter came now and then to the surface to breathe.  Its wound had<br>
not weakened it, for it shot onwards with great rapidity.<br>
<br>
The boat, rowed by strong arms, flew on its track.  Several times it<br>
approached within some few yards, and the Canadian was ready to strike,<br>
but the dugong made off with a sudden plunge, and it was impossible to<br>
reach it.<br>
<br>
Imagine the passion which excited impatient Ned Land!  He hurled at the<br>
unfortunate creature the most energetic expletives in the English<br>
tongue.  For my part, I was only vexed to see the dugong escape all our<br>
attacks.<br>
<br>
We pursued it without relaxation for an hour, and I began to think it<br>
would prove difficult to capture, when the animal, possessed with the<br>
perverse idea of vengeance of which he had cause to repent, turned upon<br>
the pinnace and assailed us in its turn.<br>
<br>
This manoeuvre did not escape the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Look out!" he cried.<br>
<br>
The coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue, doubtless<br>
warning the men to keep on their guard.<br>
<br>
The dugong came within twenty feet of the boat, stopped, sniffed the<br>
air briskly with its large nostrils (not pierced at the extremity, but<br>
in the upper part of its muzzle). Then, taking a spring, he threw<br>
himself upon us.<br>
<br>
The pinnace could not avoid the shock, and half upset, shipped at least<br>
two tons of water, which had tobe emptied; but, thanks to the<br>
coxswain, we caught it sideways, not full front, so we were not quite<br>
overturned.  While Ned Land, clinging to the bows, belaboured the<br>
gigantic animal with blows from his harpoon, the creature's teeth were<br>
buried in the gunwale, and it lifted the whole thing out of the water,<br>
as a lion does a roebuck.  We were upset over one another, and I know<br>
not how the adventure would have ended, if the Canadian, still enraged<br>
with the beast, had not struck it to the heart.<br>
<br>
I heard its teeth grind on the iron plate, and the dugong disappeared,<br>
carrying the harpoon with him.  But the barrel soon returned to the<br>
surface, and shortly after the body of the animal, turned on its back.<br>
The boat came up with it, took it in tow, and made straight for the<br>
Nautilus.<br>
<br>
It required tackle of enormous strength to hoist the dugong on to the<br>
platform.  It weighed 10,000 lb.<br>
<br>
The next day, 11th February, the larder of the Nautilus was enriched by<br>
some more delicate game.  A flight of sea-swallows rested on the<br>
Nautilus.  It was a species of the Sterna nilotica, peculiar to Egypt;<br>
its beak is black, head grey and pointed, the eye surrounded by white<br>
spots, the back, wings, and tail of a greyish colour, the belly and<br>
throat white, and claws red.  They also took some dozen of Nile ducks,<br>
a wild bird of high flavour, its throat and upper part of the head<br>
white with black spots.<br>
<br>
About five o'clock in the evening we sighted to the north the Cape of<br>
Ras-Mohammed. This cape forms the extremity of Arabia Petraea,<br>
comprised between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Acabah.<br>
<br>
The Nautilus penetrated into the Straits of Jubal, which leads to the<br>
Gulf of Suez.  I distinctly saw a high mountain, towering between the<br><a href="../site5/page1_5432.html">link2_text</a>
two gulfs of Ras-Mohammed. It was Mount Horeb, that Sinai at the top of<br>
which Moses saw God face to face.<br>
<br>
At six o'clock the Nautilus, sometimes floating, sometimes immersed,<br>
passed some distance from Tor, situated at the end of the bay, the<br>
waters of which seemed tinted with red, an observation already made by<br>
Captain Nemo.  Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence,<br>
sometimes broken by the cries of the pelican and other night-birds, and<br>
the noise of the waves breaking upon the shore, chafing against the<br>
rocks, or the panting of some far-off steamer beating the waters of the<br>
Gulf with its noisy paddles.<br>
<br>
From eight to nine o'clock the Nautilus remained some fathoms under the<br>
water.  According to my calculation we must have been very near Suez.<br>
Through the panel of the saloon I saw the bottom of the rocks<br>
brilliantly lit up by our electric lamp.  We seemed to be leaving the<br>
Straits behind us more and more.<br>
<br>
At a quarter-past nine, the vessel having returned to the surface, I<br>
mounted the platform.  Most impatient to pass through Captain Nemo's<br>
tunnel, I could not stay in one place, so came to breathe the fresh<br>
night air.<br>
<br>
Soon in the shadow I saw a pale light, half discoloured by the fog,<br>
shining about a mile from us.<br>
<br>
"A floating lighthouse!" said someone near me.<br>
<br>
I turned, and saw the Captain.<br>
<br>
"It is the floating light of Suez," he continued.  "It will not be long<br>
before we gain the entrance of the tunnel."<br>
<br>
"The entrance cannot be easy?"<br>
<br>
"No, sir; for that reason I am accustomed to go into the steersman's<br>
cage and myself direct our course.  And now, if you will go down, M.<br>
Aronnax, the Nautilus is going under the waves, and will not return to<br>
the surface until we have passed through the Arabian Tunnel."<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo led me towards the central staircase; half way down he<br>
opened a door, traversed the upper deck, and landed in the pilot's<br>
cage, which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform.<br>
It was a cabin measuring six feet square, very much like that occupied<br>
by the pilot on the steamboats of the Mississippi or Hudson.  In the<br>
midst worked a wheel, placed vertically, and caught to the tiller-rope,<br>
which ran to the back of the Nautilus.  Four light-ports with<br>
lenticular glasses, let in a groove in the partition of the cabin,<br>
allowed the man at the wheel to see in all directions.<br>
<br>
This cabin was dark; but soon my eyes accustomed themselves to the<br>
obscurity, and I perceived the pilot, a strong man, with his hands<br>
resting on the spokes of the wheel.  Outside, the sea appeared vividly<br>
lit up by the lantern, which shed its rays from the back of the cabin<br>
to the other extremity of the platform.<br>
<br>
"Now," said Captain Nemo, "let us try to make our passage."<br>
<br>
Electric wires connected the pilot's cage with the machinery room, and<br>
from there the Captain could communicate simultaneously to his Nautilus<br>
the direction and the speed.  He pressed a metal knob, and at once the<br>
speed of the screw diminished.<br>
<br>
I looked in silence at the high straight wall we were running by at<br>
this moment, the immovable base of a massive sandy coast.  We followed<br>
it thus for an hour only some few yards off.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo did not take his eye from the knob, suspended by its two<br>
concentric circles in the cabin.  At a simple gesture, the pilot<br>
modified the course of the Nautilus every instant.<br>
<br>
I had placed myself at the port-scuttle, and saw some magnificent<br>
substructures of coral, zoophytes, seaweed, and fucus, agitating their<br>
enormous claws, which stretched out from the fissures of the rock.<br>
<br>
At a quarter-past ten, the Captain himself took the helm.  A large<br>
gallery, black and deep, opened before us.  The Nautilus went boldly<br>
into it.  A strange roaring was heard round its sides.  It was the<br>
waters of the Red Sea, which the incline of the tunnel precipitated<br>
violently towards the Mediterranean.  The Nautilus went with the<br>
torrent, rapid as an arrow, in spite of the efforts of the machinery,<br>
which, in order to offer more effective resistance, beat the waves with<br>
reversed screw.<br>
<br>
On the walls of the narrow passage I could see nothing but brilliant<br>
rays, straight lines, furrows of fire, traced by the great speed, under<br>
the brilliant electric light.  My heart beat fast.<br>
<br>
At thirty-five minutes past ten, Captain Nemo quitted the helm, and,<br>
turning to me, said:<br>
<br>
"The Mediterranean!"<br>
<br>
In less than twenty minutes, the Nautilus, carried along by the<br>
torrent, had passed through the Isthmus of Suez.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI<br>
<br>
THE GRECIAN ARCHIPELAGO<br><a href="../site5/page9_2884.html">link3_text</a>
<br>
The next day, the 12th of February, at the dawn of day, the Nautilus<br>
rose to the surface.  I hastened on to the platform.  Three miles to<br>
the south the dim outline of Pelusium was to be seen.  A torrent had<br>
carried us from one sea to another.  About seven o'clock Ned and<br>
Conseil joined me.<br>
<br>
"Well, Sir Naturalist," said the Canadian, in a slightly jovial tone,<br>
"and the Mediterranean?"<br>
<br>
"We are floating on its surface, friend Ned."<br>
<br>
"What!" said Conseil, "this very night."<br>
<br>
"Yes, this very night; in a few minutes we have passed this impassable<br>
isthmus."<br>
<br>
"I do not believe it," replied the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Then you are wrong, Master Land," I continued; "this low coast which<br>
rounds off to the south is the Egyptian coast.  And you who have such<br>
good eyes, Ned, you can see the jetty of Port Said stretching into the<br>
sea."<br>
<br>
The Canadian looked attentively.<br>
<br>
"Certainly you are right, sir, and your Captain is a first-rate man.<br>
We are in the Mediterranean.  Good!  Now, if you please, let us talk of<br>
our own little affair, but so that no one hearsus."<br>
<br>
I saw what the Canadian wanted, and, in any case, I thought it better<br>
to let him talk, as he wished it; so we all three went and sat down<br>
near the lantern, where we were less exposed to the spray of the blades.<br>
<br>
"Now, Ned, we listen; what have you to tell us?"<br>
<br>
"What I have to tell you is very simple.  We are in Europe; and before<br>
Captain Nemo's caprices drag us once more to the bottom of the Polar<br>
Seas, or lead us into Oceania, I ask to leave the Nautilus."<br>
<br>
I wished in no way to shackle the liberty of my companions, but I<br>
certainly felt no desire to leave Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
Thanks to him, and thanks to his apparatus, I was each day nearer the<br>
completion of my submarine studies; and I was rewriting my book of<br>
submarine depths in its very element.  Should I ever again have such an<br>
opportunity of observing the wonders of the ocean?  No, certainly not!<br>
And I could not bring myself to the idea of abandoning the Nautilus<br>
before the cycle of investigation was accomplished.<br>
<br>
"Friend Ned, answer me frankly, are you tired of being on board?  Are<br>
you sorry that destiny has thrown us into Captain Nemo's hands?"<br>
<br>
The Canadian remained some moments without answering.  Then, crossing<br>
his arms, he said:<br>
<br>
"Frankly, I do not regret this journey under the seas.  I shall be glad<br>
to have made it; but, now that it is made, let us have done with it.<br>
That is my idea."<br>
<br>
"It will come to an end, Ned."<br>
<br>
"Where and when?"<br>
<br>
"Where I do not know--when I cannot say; or, rather, I suppose it will<br>
end when these seas have nothing more to teach us."<br>
<br>
"Then what do you hope for?" demanded the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"That circumstances may occur as well six months hence as now by which<br>
we may and ought to profit."<br>
<br>
"Oh!" said Ned Land, "and where shall we be in six months, if you<br>
please, Sir Naturalist?"<br>
<br>
"Perhaps in China; you know the Nautilus is a rapid traveller.  It goes<br>
through water as swallows through the air, or as an express on the<br>
land.  It does not fear frequented seas; who can say that it may not<br>
beat the coasts of France, England, or America, on which flight may be<br>
attempted as advantageously as here."<br>
<br>
"M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian, "your arguments are rotten at the<br>
foundation.  You speak in the future, `We shall be there!  we shall be<br>
here!'  I speak in the present, `We are here, and we must profit by<br>
it.'"<br>
<br>
Ned Land's logic pressed me hard, and I felt myself beaten on that<br>
ground.  I knew not what argument would now tell in my favour.<br>
<br>
"Sir," continued Ned, "let us suppose an impossibility: if Captain Nemo<br>
should this day offer you your liberty; would you accept it?"<br>
<br>
"I do not know," I answered.<br>
<br>
"And if," he added, "the offer made you this day was never to be<br>
renewed, would you accept it?"<br>
<br>
"Friend Ned, this is my answer.  Your reasoning is against me.  We must<br>
not rely on Captain Nemo's good-will. Common prudence forbids him to<br>
set us at liberty.  On the other side, prudence bids us profit by the<br>
first opportunity to leave the Nautilus."<br><a href="../site9/page9_3383.html">link4_text</a>
<br>
"Well, M. Aronnax, that is wisely said."<br>
<br>
"Only one observation--just one.  The occasion must be serious, and our<br>
first attempt must succeed; if it fails, we shall never find another,<br>
and Captain Nemo will never forgive us."<br>
<br>
"All that is true," replied the Canadian.  "But your observation<br>
applies equally to all attempts at flight, whether in two years' time,<br>
or in two days'. But the question is still this: If a favourable<br>
opportunity presents itself, it must be seized."<br>
<br>
"Agreed!  And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by a favourable<br>
opportunity?"<br>
<br>
"It will be that which, on a dark night, will bring the Nautilus a<br>
short distance from some European coast."<br>
<br>
"And you will try and save yourself by swimming?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, if we were near enough to the bank, and if the vessel was<br>
floating at the time.  Not if the bank was far away, and the boat was<br>
under the water."<br>
<br>
"And in that case?"<br>
<br>
"In that case, I should seek to make myself master of the pinnace.  I<br>
know how it is worked.  We must get inside, and the bolts once drawn,<br>
we shall come to the surface of the water, without even the pilot, who<br>
is in the bows, perceiving our flight."<br>
<br>
"Well, Ned, watch for the opportunity; but do not forget that a hitch<br>
will ruin us."<br>
<br>
"I will not forget, sir."<br>
<br>
"And now, Ned, would you like to know what I think of your project?"<br>
<br>
"Certainly, M. Aronnax."<br>
<br>
"Well, I think--I do not say I hope--I think that this favourable<br>
opportunity will never present itself."<br>
<br>
"Why not?"<br>
<br>
"Because Captain Nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given<br>
up all hope of regaining our liberty, and he will be on his guard,<br>
above all, in the seas and in the sight of European coasts."<br>
<br>
"We shall see," replied Ned Land, shaking his head determinedly.<br>
<br>
"And now, Ned Land," I added, "let us stop here.  Not another word on<br>
the subject.  The day that you are ready, come and let us know, and we<br>
will follow you.  I rely entirely upon you."<br>
<br>
Thus ended a conversation which, at no very distant time, led to such<br>
grave results.  I must say here that facts seemed to confirm my<br>
foresight, to the Canadian's great despair.  Did Captain Nemo distrust<br>
us in these frequented seas? or did he only wish to hide himself from<br>
the numerous vessels, of all nations, which ploughed the Mediterranean?<br>
I could not tell; but we were oftener between waters and far from the<br>
coast.  Or, if the Nautilus did emerge, nothing was to be seen but the<br>
pilot's cage; and sometimes it went to great depths, for, between the<br>
Grecian Archipelago and Asia Minor we could not touch the bottom by<br>
more than a thousand fathoms.<br>
<br>
Thus I only knew we were near the Island of Carpathos, one of the<br>
Sporades, by Captain Nemo reciting these lines from Virgil:<br>
<br>
    "Est Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates,<br>
     Caeruleus Proteus,"<br>
<br>
as he pointed to a spot on the planisphere.<br>
<br>
It was indeed the ancient abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of<br>
Neptune's flocks, now the Island of Scarpanto, situated between Rhodes<br>
and Crete.  I saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels<br>
of the saloon.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 14th of February, I resolved to employ some hours in<br>
studying the fishes of the Archipelago; but for some reason or other<br>
the panels remained hermetically sealed.  Upon taking the course of the<br>
Nautilus, I found that we were going towards Candia, the ancient Isle<br>
of Crete.  At the time I embarked on the Abraham Lincoln, the whole of<br>
this island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the<br>
Turks.  But how the insurgents had fared since that time I was<br>
absolutely ignorant, and it was not Captain Nemo, deprived of all land<br>
communications, who could tell me.<br>
<br>
I made no allusion to this event when that night I found myself alone<br>
with him in the saloon.  Besides, he seemed to be taciturn and<br>
preoccupied.  Then, contrary to his custom, he ordered both panels to<br>
be opened, and, going from one to the other, observed the mass of<br>
waters attentively.  To what end I could not guess; so, on my side, I<br>
employed my time in studying the fish passing before my eyes.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the waters a man appeared, a diver, carrying at his<br>
belt a leathern purse.  It was not a body abandoned to the waves; it<br>
was a living man, swimming with a strong hand, disappearing<br>
occasionally to take breath at the surface.<br>
<br><a href="../sit5/page8_6348.html">link5_text</a>
I turned towards Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice exclaimed:<br>
<br>
"A man shipwrecked!  He must be saved at any price!"<br>
<br>
The Captain did not answer me, but came and leaned against the panel.<br>
<br>
The man had approached, and, with his face flattened against the glass,<br>
was looking at us.<br>
<br>
To my great amazement, Captain Nemo signed to him.  The diver answered<br>
with his hand, mounted immediately to the surface of the water, and did<br>
not appear again.<br>
<br>
"Do not be uncomfortable," said Captain Nemo.  "It is Nicholas of Cape<br>
Matapan, surnamed Pesca.  He is well known in all the Cyclades.  A bold<br>
diver! water is his element, and he lives more in it than on land,<br>
going continually from one island to another, even as far as Crete."<br>
<br>
"You know him, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"Why not, M. Aronnax?"<br>
<br>
Saying which, Captain Nemo went towards a piece of furniture standing<br>
near the left panel of the saloon.  Near this piece of furniture, I saw<br>
a chest bound with iron, on the cover of which was a copper plate,<br>
bearing the cypher of the Nautilus with its device.<br>
<br>
At that moment, the Captain, without noticing my presence, opened the<br>
piece of furniture, a sort of strong box, which held a great many<br>
ingots.<br>
<br>
They were ingots of gold.  From whence came this precious metal, which<br>
represented an enormous sum?  Where did the Captain gather this gold<br>
from? and what was he going to do with it?<br>
<br>
I did not say one word.  I looked.  Captain Nemo took the ingots one by<br>
one, and arranged them methodically in the chest, which he filled<br>
entirely.  I estimated the contents at more than 4,000 lb. weight of<br>
gold, that is to say, nearly L200,000.<br>
<br>
The chest was securely fastened, and the Captain wrote an address on<br>
the lid, in characters which must have belonged to Modern Greece.<br>
<br>
This done, Captain Nemo pressed a knob, the wire of which communicated<br>
with the quarters of the crew.  Four men appeared, and, not without<br>
some trouble, pushed the chest out of the saloon.  Then I heard them<br>
hoisting it up the iron staircase by means of pulleys.<br>
<br>
At that moment, Captain Nemo turned to me.<br>
<br>
"And you were saying, sir?" said he.<br>
<br>
"I was saying nothing, Captain."<br>
<br>
"Then, sir, if you will allow me, I will wish you good night."<br>
<br>
Whereupon he turned and left the saloon.<br>
<br>
I returned to my room much troubled, as one may believe.  I vainly<br>
tried to sleep--I sought the connecting link between the apparition of<br>
the diver and the chest filled with gold.  Soon, I felt by certain<br>
movements of pitching and tossing that the Nautilus was leaving the<br>
depths and returning to the surface.<br>
<br>
Then I heard steps upon the platform; and I knew they were unfastening<br>
the pinnace and launching it upon the waves.  For one instant it struck<br>
the side of the Nautilus, then all noise ceased.<br>
<br>
Two hours after, the same noise, the same going and coming was renewed;<br>
the boat was hoisted on board, replaced in its socket, and the Nautilus<br>
again plunged under the waves.<br>
<br>
So these millions had been transported to their address.  To what point<br>
of the continent?  Who was Captain Nemo's correspondent?<br>
<br>
The next day I related to Conseil and the Canadian the events of the<br>
night, which had excited my curiosity to the highest degree.  My<br>
companions were not less surprised than myself.<br>
<br>
"But where does he take his millions to?" asked Ned Land.<br>
<br>
To that there was no possible answer.  I returned to the saloon after<br>
having breakfast and set to work.  Till five o'clock in the evening I<br>
employed myself in arranging my notes.  At that moment--(ought I to<br>
attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasy)--I felt so great a heat<br>
that I was obliged to take off my coat.  It was strange, for we were<br>
under low latitudes; and even then the Nautilus, submerged as it was,<br>
ought to experience no change of temperature.  I looked at the<br>
manometer; it showed a depth of sixty feet, to which atmospheric heat<br>
could never attain.<br>
<br>
I continued my work, but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be<br>
intolerable.<br>
<br>
"Could there be fire on board?"  I asked myself.<br>
<br>
I was leaving the saloon, when Captain Nemo entered; he approached the<br>
thermometer, consulted it, and, turning to me, said:<br>
<br>
"Forty-two degrees."<br>
<br><a href="../site6/page8_4863.html">link6_text</a>
"I have noticed it, Captain," I replied; "and if it gets much hotter we<br>
cannot bear it."<br>
<br>
"Oh, sir, it will not get better if we do not wish it."<br>
<br>
"You can reduce it as you please, then?"<br>
<br>
"No; but I can go farther from the stove which produces it."<br>
<br>
"It is outward, then!"<br>
<br>
"Certainly; we are floating in a current of boiling water."<br>
<br>
"Is it possible!"  I exclaimed.<br>
<br>
"Look."<br>
<br>
The panels opened, and I saw the sea entirely white all round.  A<br>
sulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves, which boiled like water in<br>
a copper.  I placed my hand on one of the panes of glass, but the heat<br>
was so great that I quickly took it off again.<br>
<br>
"Where are we?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Near the Island of Santorin, sir," replied the Captain.  "I wished to<br>
give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption."<br>
<br>
"I thought," said I, "that the formation of these new islands was<br>
ended."<br>
<br>
"Nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea," replied<br>
Captain Nemo; "and the globe is always being worked by subterranean<br>
fires.  Already, in the nineteenth year of our era, according to<br>
Cassiodorus and Pliny, a new island, Theia (the divine), appeared in<br>
the very place where these islets have recently been formed.  Then they<br>
sank under the waves, to rise again in the year 69, when they again<br>
subsided.  Since that time to our days the Plutonian work has been<br>
suspended.  But on the 3rd of February, 1866, a new island, which they<br>
named George Island, emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour<br>
near Nea Kamenni, and settled again the 6th of the same month.  Seven<br>
days after, the 13th of February, the Island of Aphroessa appeared,<br>
leaving between Nea Kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad.  I was<br>
in these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and I was able therefore to<br>
observe all the different phases.  The Island of Aphroessa, of round<br>
form, measured 300 feet in diameter, and 30 feet in height.  It was<br>
composed of black and vitreous lava, mixed with fragments of felspar.<br>
And lastly, on the 10th of March, a smaller island, called Reka, showed<br>
itself near Nea Kamenni, and since then these three have joined<br>
together, forming but one and the same island."<br>
<br>
"And the canal in which we are at this moment?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Here it is," replied Captain Nemo, showing me a map of the<br>
Archipelago.  "You see, I have marked the new islands."<br>
<br>
I returned to the glass.  The Nautilus was no longer moving, the heat<br>
was becoming unbearable.  The sea, which till now had been white, was<br>
red, owing to the presence of salts of iron.  In spite of the ship's<br>
being hermetically sealed, an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the<br>
saloon, and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished<br>
by bright scarlet flames.  I was in a bath, I was choking, I was<br>
broiled.<br>
<br>
"We can remain no longer in this boiling water," said I to the Captain.<br>
<br>
"It would not be prudent," replied the impassive Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
An order was given; the Nautilus tacked about and left the furnace it<br>
could not brave with impunity.  A quarter of an hour after we were<br>
breathing fresh air on the surface.  The thought then struck me that,<br>
f Ned Land had chosen this part of the sea for our flight, we should<br>
never have come alive out of this sea of fire.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 16th of February, we left the basin which, between<br>
Rhodes and Alexandria, is reckoned about 1,500 fathoms in depth, and<br>
the Nautilus, passing some distance from Cerigo, quitted the Grecian<br>
Archipelago after having doubled Cape Matapan.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII<br>
<br>
THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS<br>
<br>
The Mediterranean, the blue sea par excellence, "the great sea" of the<br>
Hebrews, "the sea" of the Greeks, the "mare nostrum" of the Romans,<br>
bordered by orange-trees, aloes, cacti, and sea-pines; embalmed with<br>
the perfume of the myrtle, surrounded by rude mountains, saturated with<br>
pure and transparent air, but incessantly worked by underground fires;<br>
a perfect battlefield in which Neptune and Pluto still dispute the<br>
empire of the world!<br>
<br>
It is upon these banks, and on these waters, says Michelet, that man is<br>
renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe.  But,<br>
beautiful as it was, I could only take a rapid glance at the basin<br>
whose superficial area is two million of square yards.  Even Captain<br>
Nemo's knowledge was lost to me, for this puzzling person did not<br>
appear once during our passage at full speed.  I estimated the course<br>
which the Nautilus took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred<br>
leagues, and it was accomplished in forty-eight hours.  Starting on the<br>
morning of the 16th of February from the shores of Greece, we had<br><a href="../site5/page4_5248.html">link7_text</a>
crossed the Straits of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.<br>
<br>
It was plain to me that this Mediterranean, enclosed in the midst of<br>
those countries which he wished to avoid, was distasteful to Captain<br>
Nemo.  Those waves and those breezes brought back too many<br>
remembrances, if not too many regrets.  Here he had no longer that<br>
independence and that liberty of gait which he had when in the open<br>
seas, and his Nautilus felt itself cramped between the close shores of<br>
Africa and Europe.<br>
<br>
Our speed was now twenty-five miles an hour.  It may be well understood<br>
that Ned Land, to his great disgust, was obliged to renounce his<br>
intended flight.  He could not launch the pinnace, going at the rate of<br>
twelve or thirteen yards every second.  To quit the Nautilus under such<br>
conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full<br>
speed--an imprudent thing, to say the least of it.  Besides, our vessel<br>
only mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew its stock of<br>
air; it was steered entirely by the compass and the log.<br>
<br>
I saw no more of the interior of this Mediterranean than a traveller by<br>
express train perceives of the landscape which flies before his eyes;<br>
that is to say, the distant horizon, and not the nearer objects which<br>
pass like a flash of lightning.<br>
<br>
We were then passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunis.  In the<br>
narrow space between Cape Bon and the Straits of Messina the bottom of<br>
the sea rose almost suddenly.  There was a perfect bank, on which there<br>
was not more than nine fathoms of water, whilst on either side the<br>
depth was ninety fathoms.<br>
<br>
The Nautilus had to manoeuvre very carefully so as not to strike<br>
against this submarine barrier.<br>
<br>
I showed Conseil, on the map of the Mediterranean, the spot occupied by<br>
this reef.<br>
<br>
"But if you please, sir," observed Conseil, "it is like a real isthmus<br>
joining Europe to Africa."<br>
<br>
"Yes, my boy, it forms a perfect bar to the Straits of Lybia, and the<br>
soundings of Smith have proved that in former times the continents<br>
between Cape Boco and Cape Furina were joined."<br>
<br>
"I can well believe it," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"I will add," I continued, "that a similar barrier exists between<br>
Gibraltar and Ceuta, which in geological times formed the entire<br>
Mediterranean."<br>
<br>
"What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers<br>
above the waves?"<br>
<br>
"It is not probable, Conseil."<br>
<br>
"Well, but allow me to finish, please, sir; if this phenomenon should<br>
take place, it will be troublesome for M. Lesseps, who has taken so<br>
much pains to pierce the isthmus."<br>
<br>
"I agree with you; but I repeat, Conseil, this phenomenon will never<br>
happen.  The violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing.<br>
Volcanoes, so plentiful in the first days of the world, are being<br>
extinguished by degrees; the internal heat is weakened, the temperature<br>
of the lower strata of the globe is lowered by a perceptible quantity<br>
every century to the detriment of our globe, for its heat is its life."<br>
<br>
"But the sun?"<br>
<br>
"The sun is not sufficient, Conseil.  Can it give heat to a dead body?"<br>
<br>
"Not that I know of."<br>
<br>
"Well, my friend, this earth will one day be that cold corpse; it will<br>
become uninhabitable and uninhabited like the moon, which has long<br>
since lost all its vital heat."<br>
<br>
"In how many centuries?"<br>
<br>
"In some hundreds of thousands of years, my boy."<br>
<br>
"Then," said Conseil, "we shall have time to finish our journey--that<br>
is, if Ned Land does not interfere with it."<br>
<br>
And Conseil, reassured, returned to the study of the bank, which the<br>
Nautilus was skirting at a moderate speed.<br>
<br>
During the night of the 16th and 17th February we had entered the<br>
second Mediterranean basin, the greatest depth of which was 1,450<br>
fathoms.  The Nautilus, by the action of its crew, slid down the<br>
inclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea.<br>
<br>
On the 18th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, we were at<br>
the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar.  There once existed two<br>
currents: an upper one, long since recognised, which conveys the waters<br>
of the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; and a lower<br>
counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist.  Indeed, the<br>
volume of water in the Mediterranean, incessantly added to by the waves<br>
of the Atlantic and by rivers falling into it, would each year raise<br>
the level of this sea, for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore<br>
the equilibrium.  As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the<br>
existence of an under-current, which empties into the basin of the<br>
Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar the surplus waters of the<br><a href="../site5/page7_6650.html">link8_text</a>
Mediterranean.  A fact indeed; and it was this counter-current by which<br>
the Nautilus profited.  It advanced rapidly by the narrow pass.  For<br>
one instant I caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of<br>
Hercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low<br>
island which supports it; and a few minutes later we were floating on<br>
the Atlantic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VIII<br>
<br>
VIGO BAY<br>
<br>
The Atlantic! a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers<br>
twenty-five millions of square miles, the length of which is nine<br>
thousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred--an<br>
ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference,<br>
watered by the largest rivers of the world, the St. Lawrence, the<br>
Mississippi, the Amazon, the Plata, the Orinoco, the Niger, the<br>
Senegal, the Elbe, the Loire, and the Rhine, which carry water from the<br>
most civilised, as well as from the most savage, countries!<br>
Magnificent field of water, incessantly ploughed by vessels of every<br>
nation, sheltered by the flags of every nation, and which terminates in<br>
those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners, Cape Horn and the<br>
Cape of Tempests.<br>
<br>
The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having<br>
accomplished nearly ten thousand leaues in three months and a half, a<br>
distance greater than the great circle of the earth.  Where were we<br>
going now, and what was reserved for the future?  The Nautilus, leaving<br>
the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone far out.  It returned to the surface<br>
of the waves, and our daily walks on the platform were restored to us.<br>
<br>
I mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil.  At a distance<br>
of about twelve miles, Cape St. Vincent was dimly to be seen, forming<br>
the south-western point of the Spanish peninsula.  A strong southerly<br>
gale was blowing.  The sea was swollen and billowy; it made the<br>
Nautilus rock violently.  It was almost impossible to keep one's foot<br>
on the platform, which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every<br>
instant.  So we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air.<br>
<br>
I returned to my room, Conseil to his cabin; but the Canadian, with a<br>
preoccupied air, followed me.  Our rapid passage across the<br>
Mediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution,<br>
and he could not help showing his disappointment.  When the door of my<br>
room was shut, he sat down and looked at me silently.<br>
<br>
"Friend Ned," said I, "I understand you; but you cannot reproach<br>
yourself.  To have attempted to leave the Nautilus under the<br>
circumstances would have been folly."<br>
<br>
Ned Land did not answer; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed<br>
with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind.<br>
<br>
"Let us see," I continued; "we need not despair yet.  We are going up<br>
the coast of Portugal again; France and England are not far off, where<br>
we can easily find refuge.  Now if the Nautilus, on leaving the Straits<br>
of Gibraltar, had gone to the south, if it had carried us towards<br>
regions where there were no continents, I should share your uneasiness.<br>
But we know now that Captain Nemo does not fly from civilised seas, and<br>
in some days I think you can act with security."<br>
<br>
Ned Land still looked at me fixedly; at length his fixed lips parted,<br>
and he said, "It is for to-night."<br>
<br>
I drew myself up suddenly.  I was, I admit, little prepared for this<br>
communication.  I wanted to answer the Canadian, but words would not<br>
come.<br>
<br>
"We agreed to wait for an opportunity," continued Ned Land, "and the<br>
opportunity has arrived.  This night we shall be but a few miles from<br>
the Spanish coast.  It is cloudy.  The wind blows freely.  I have your<br>
word, M. Aronnax, and I rely upon you."<br>
<br>
As I was silent, the Canadian approached me.<br>
<br>
"To-night, at nine o'clock," said he.  "I have warned Conseil.  At that<br>
moment Captain Nemo will be shut up in his room, probably in bed.<br>
Neither the engineers nor the ship's crew can see us.  Conseil and I<br>
will gain the central staircase, and you, M. Aronnax, will remain in<br>
the library, two steps from us, waiting my signal.  The oars, the mast,<br>
and the sail are in the canoe.  I have even succeeded in getting some<br>
provisions.  I have procured an English wrench, to unfasten the bolts<br>
which attach it to the shell of the Nautilus.  So all is ready, till<br>
to-night."<br>
<br>
"The sea is bad."<br>
<br>
"That I allow," replied the Canadian; "but we must risk that.  Liberty<br>
is worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with<br>
a fair wind to carry us is no great thing.  Who knows but by to-morrow<br>
we may be a hundred leagues away?  Let circumstances only favour us,<br>
and by ten or eleven o'clock we shall have landed on some spot of terra<br>
firma, alive or dead.  But adieu now till to-night."<br>
<br>
With these words the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost dumb.  I had<br>
imagined that, the chance gone, I should have time to reflect and<br>
discuss the matter.  My obstinate companion had given me no time; and,<br>
after all, what could I have said to him?  Ned Land was perfectly<br>
right.  There was almost the opportunity to profit by.  Could I retract<br>
my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the<br><a href="../site9/page0_7639.html">link9_text</a>
future of my companions?  To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from<br>
all land.<br>
<br>
At that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs<br>
were filling, and that the Nautilus was sinking under the waves of the<br>
Atlantic.<br>
<br>
A sad day I passed, between the desire of regaining my liberty of<br>
action and of abandoning the wonderful Nautilus, and leaving my<br>
submarine studies incomplete.<br>
<br>
What dreadful hours I passed thus!  Sometimes seeing myself and<br>
companions safely landed, sometimes wishing, in spite of my reason,<br>
that some unforeseen circumstance, would prevent the realisation of Ned<br>
Land's project.<br>
<br>
Twice I went to the saloon.  I wished to consult the compass.  I wished<br>
to see if the direction the Nautilus was taking was bringing us nearer<br>
or taking us farther from the coast.  But no; the Nautilus kept in<br>
Portuguese waters.<br>
<br>
I must therefore take my part and prepare for flight.  My luggage was<br>
not heavy; my notes, nothing more.<br>
<br>
As to Captain Nemo, I asked myself what he would think of our escape;<br>
what trouble, what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in<br>
case of its discovery or failure.  Certainly I had no cause to complain<br>
of him; on the contrary, never was hospitality freer than his.  In<br>
leaving him I could not be taxed with ingratitude.  No oath bound us to<br>
him.  It was on the strength of circumstances he relied, and not upon<br>
our word, to fix us for ever.<br>
<br>
I had not seen the Captain since our visit to the Island of Santorin.<br>
Would chance bring me to his presence before our departure?  I wished<br>
it, and I feared it at the same time.  I listened if I could hear him<br>
walking the room contiguous to mine.  No sound reached my ear.  I felt<br>
an unbearable uneasiness.  This day of waiting seemed eternal.  Hours<br>
struck too slowly to keep pace with my impatience.<br>
<br>
My dinner was served in my room as usual.  I ate but little; I was too<br>
preoccupied.  I left the table at seven o'clock. A hundred and twenty<br>
minutes (I counted them) still separated me from the moment in which I<br>
was to join Ned Land.  My agitation redoubled.  My pulse beat<br>
violently.  I could not remain quiet.  I went and came, hoping to calm<br>
my troubled spirit by constant movement.  The idea of failure in our<br>
bold enterprise was the least painful of my anxieties; but the thought<br>
of seeing our project discovered before leaving the Nautilus, of being<br>
brought before Captain Nemo, irritated, or (what was worse) saddened,<br>
at my desertion, made my heart beat.<br>
<br>
I wanted to see the saloon for the last time.  I descended the stairs<br>
and arrived in the museum, where I had passed so many useful and<br>
agreeable hours.  I looked at all its riches, all its treasures, like a<br>
man on the eve of an eternal exile, who was leaving never to return.<br>
<br>
These wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for<br>
so many days my life had been concentrated, I was going to abandon them<br>
for ever!  I should like to have taken a last look through the windows<br>
of the saloon into the waters of the Atlantic:  but the panels were<br>
hermetically closed, and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean<br>
which I had not yet explored.<br>
<br>
In passing through the saloon, I came near the door let into the angle<br>
which opened into the Captain's room.  To my great surprise, this door<br>
was ajar.  I drew back involuntarily.  If Captain Nemo should be in his<br>
room, he could see me.  But, hearing no sound, I drew nearer.  The room<br>
was deserted.  I pushed open the door and took some steps forward.<br>
Still the same monklike severity of aspect.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the clock struck eight.  he first beat of the hammer on the<br>
bell awoke me from my dreams.  I trembled as if an invisible eye had<br>
plunged into my most secret thoughts, and I hurried from the room.<br>
<br>
There my eye fell upon the compass.  Our course was still north.  The<br>
log indicated moderate speed, the manometer a depth of about sixty feet.<br>
<br>
I returned to my room, clothed myself warmly--sea boots, an otterskin<br>
cap, a great coat of byssus, lined with sealskin; I was ready, I was<br>
waiting.  The vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which<br>
reigned on board.  I listened attentively.  Would no loud voice<br>
suddenly inform me that Ned Land had been surprised in his projected<br>
flight.  A mortal dread hung over me, and I vainly tried to regain my<br>
accustomed coolness.<br>
<br>
At a few minutes to nine, I put my ear to the Captain's door.  No<br>
noise.  I left my room and returned to the saloon, which was half in<br>
obscurity, but deserted.<br>
<br>
I opened the door communicating with the library.  The same<br>
insufficient light, the same solitude.  I placed myself near the door<br>
leading to the central staircase, and there waited for Ned Land's<br>
signal.<br>
<br>
At that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished, then it<br>
stopped entirely.  The silence was now only disturbed by the beatings<br>
of my own heart.  Suddenly a slight shock was felt; and I knew that the<br>
Nautilus had stopped at the bottom of the ocean.  My uneasiness<br>
increased.  The Canadian's signal did not come.  I felt inclined to<br>
join Ned Land and beg of him to put off his attempt.  I felt that we<br>
