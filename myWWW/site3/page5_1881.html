A SHIFTING REEF<br>
<br>
The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and<br>
puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten.  Not to<br>
mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the<br>
public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were<br>
particularly excited.  Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels,<br>
skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries,<br>
and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were<br>
deeply interested in the matter.<br>
<br>
For some time past vessels had been met by "an enormous thing," a long<br>
object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely<br>
larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.<br>
<br>
The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)<br>
agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in<br>
question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power<br>
of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed.  If<br>
it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in<br>
science.  Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at<br>
divers times--rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to<br>
this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated<br>
opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length--we<br>
might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all<br>
dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at<br>
all.  And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that<br>
tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we<br>
can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this<br>
supernatural apparition.  As to classing it in the list of fables, the<br>
idea was out of the question.<br>
<br>
On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the<br>
Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass<br>
five miles off the east coast of Australia.  Captain Baker thought at<br>
first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even<br>
prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water,<br>
projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred<br>
and fifty feet up into the air.  Now, unless the sandbank had been<br>
submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor<br>
Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal,<br>
unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water<br>
mixed with air and vapour.<br>
<br>
Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in<br>
the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam<br>
Navigation Company.  But this extraordinary creature could transport<br>
itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an<br>
interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had<br>
observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a<br>
distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.<br>
<br>
Fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, the Helvetia, of<br>
the Compagnie-Nationale, and the Shannon, of the Royal Mail Steamship<br>
Company, sailing to windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying<br>
between the United States and Europe, respectively signalled the<br>
monster to each other in 42° 15' N. lat. and 60° 35' W. long.<br>
In these simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in<br>
estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred<br>
and fifty feet, as the Shannon and Helvetia were of smaller dimensions<br>
than it, though they measured three hundred feet over all.<br>
<br>
Now the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea<br>
round the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never<br>
exceeded the length of sixty yards, if they attain that.<br>
<br>
In every place of great resort the monster was the fashion.  They sang<br>
of it in the cafes, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on<br>
the stage.  All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it.  There<br>
appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary<br>
creature, from the white whale, the terrible "Moby Dick" of sub-arctic<br>
regions, to the immense kraken, whose tentacles could entangle a ship<br>
of five hundred tons and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean.  The<br>
legends of ancient times were even revived.<br>
<br>
Then burst forth the unending argument between the believers and the<br>
unbelievers in the societies of the wise and the scientific journals.<br>
"The question of the monster" inflamed all minds.  Editors of<br>
scientific journals, quarrelling with believers in the supernatural,<br>
spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing<br>
blood; for from the sea-serpent they came to direct personalities.<br>
<br>
During the first months of the year 1867 the question seemed buried,<br>
never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public.  It was<br>
then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger<br>
seriously to be avoided.  The question took quite another shape.  The<br>
monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite<br>
and shifting proportions.<br>
<br>
On the 5th of March, 1867, the Moravian, of the Montreal Ocean Company,<br>
finding herself during the night in 27° 30' lat. and 72° 15'<br>
long., struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for<br>
that part of the sea.  Under the combined efforts of the wind and its<br>
four hundred horse power, it was going at the rate of thirteen knots.<br>
Had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the Moravian,<br>
she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with the 237<br>
passengers she was bringing home from Canada.<br>
<br>
The accident happened about five o'clock in the morning, as the day was<br>
breaking.  The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part<br>
of the vessel.  They examined the sea with the most careful attention.<br><a href="../site3/page0_3534.html">link1_text</a>
They saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables' length distant,<br>
as if the surface had been violently agitated.  The bearings of the<br>
place were taken exactly, and the Moravian continued its route without<br>
apparent damage.  Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous<br>
wreck?  They could not tell; but, on examination of the ship's bottom<br>
when undergoing repairs, it was found that part of her keel was broken.<br>
<br>
This fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten like<br>
many others if, three weeks after, it had not been re-enacted under<br>
similar circumstances.  But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of<br>
the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel<br>
belonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated.<br>
<br>
The 13th of April, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze<br>
favourable, the Scotia, of the Cunard Company's line, found herself in<br>
15° 12' long. and 45° 37' lat.  She was going at the speed of<br>
thirteen knots and a half.<br>
<br>
At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers<br>
were assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on<br>
the hull of the Scotia, on her quarter, a little aft of the port-paddle.<br>
<br>
The Scotia had not struck, but she had been struck, and seemingly by<br>
something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt.  The shock had been<br>
so slight that no one had been alarmed, had it not been for the shouts<br>
of the carpenter's watch, who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, "We<br>
are sinking! we are sinking!"  At first the passengers were much<br>
frightened, but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them.  The danger<br>
could not be imminent.  The Scotia, divided into seven compartments by<br>
strong partitions, could brave with impunity any leak.  Captain<br>
Anderson went down immediately into the hold.  He found that the sea<br>
was pouring into the fifth compartment; and the rapidity of the influx<br>
proved that the force of the water was considerable.  Fortunately this<br>
compartment did not hold the boilers, or the fires would have been<br>
immediately extinguished.  Captain Anderson ordered the engines to be<br>
stopped at once, and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent<br>
of the injury.  Some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence<br>
of a large hole, two yards in diameter, in the ship's bottom.  Such a<br>
leak could not be stopped; and the Scotia, her paddles half submerged,<br>
was obliged to continue her course.  She was then three hundred miles<br>
from Cape Clear, and, after three days' delay, which caused great<br>
uneasiness in Liverpool, she entered the basin of the company.<br>
<br>
The engineers visited the Scotia, which was put in dry dock.  They<br>
could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below<br>
water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle.<br>
The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it<br>
could not have been more neatly done by a punch.  It was clear, then,<br>
that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common stamp<br>
and, after having been driven with prodigious strength, and piercing an<br>
iron plate 1 3/8 inches thick, had withdrawn itself by a backward<br>
motion.<br>
<br>
Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the<br>
torrent of public opinion.  From this moment all unlucky casualties<br>
which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the monster.<br>
<br>
Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all these<br>
shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three<br>
thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyd's, the number<br>
of sailing and steam-ships supposed to be totally lost, from the<br>
absence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred!<br>
<br>
Now, it was the "monster" who, justly or unjustly, was accused of their<br>
disappearance, and, thanks to it, communication between the different<br>
continents became more and more dangerous.  The public demanded sharply<br>
that the seas should at any price be relieved from this formidable<br>
cetacean.[1]<br>

CHAPTER II<br>
<br>
PRO AND CON<br>
<br>
At the period when these events took place, I had just returned from a<br>
scientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the<br>
United States.  In virtue of my office as Assistant Professor in the<br>
Museum of Natural History in Paris, the French Government had attached<br>
me to that expedition.  After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New<br>
York towards the end of March, laden with a precious collection.  My<br>
departure for France was fixed for the first days in May.  Meanwhile I<br>
was occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and<br>
zoological riches, when the accident happened to the Scotia.<br>
<br>
I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day.<br>
How could I be otherwise?  I had read and reread all the American and<br>
European papers without being any nearer a conclusion.  This mystery<br>
puzzled me.  Under the impossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped<br>
from one extreme to the other.  That there really was something could<br>
not be doubted, and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on<br>
the wound of the Scotia.<br>
<br>
On my arrival at New York the question was at its height.  The theory<br>
of the floating island, and the unapproachable sandbank, supported by<br>
minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned.  And, indeed,<br>
unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its<br><a href="../site3/page9_4705.html">link2_text</a>
position with such astonishing rapidity?<br>
<br>
From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck<br>
was given up.<br>
<br>
There remained, then, only two possible solutions of the question,<br>
which created two distinct parties:  on one side, those who were for a<br>
monster of colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a<br>
submarine vessel of enormous motive power.<br>
<br>
But this last theory, plausible as it was, could not stand against<br>
inquiries made in both worlds.  That a private gentleman should have<br>
such a machine at his command was not likely.  Where, when, and how was<br>
it built? and how could its construction have been kept secret?<br>
Certainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine.  And<br>
in these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the<br>
power of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the knowledge of<br>
others, a State might try to work such a formidable engine.<br>
<br>
But the idea of a war machine fell before the declaration of<br>
Governments.  As public interest was in question, and transatlantic<br>
communications suffered, their veracity could not be doubted.  But how<br>
admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the<br>
public eye?  For a private gentleman to keep the secret under such<br>
circumstances would be very difficult, and for a State whose every act<br>
is persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly impossible.<br>
<br>
Upon my arrival in New York several persons did me the honour of<br>
consulting me on the phenomenon in question.  I had published in France<br>
a work in quarto, in two volumes, entitled Mysteries of the Great<br>
Submarine Grounds.  This book, highly approved of in the learned world,<br>
gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of<br>
Natural History.  My advice was asked.  As long as I could deny the<br>
reality of the fact, I confined myself to a decided negative.  But<br>
soon, finding myself driven into a corner, I was obliged to explain<br>
myself point by point.  I discussed the question in all its forms,<br>
politically and scientifically; and I give here an extract from a<br>
carefully-studied article which I published in the number of the 30th<br>
of April.  It ran as follows:<br>
<br>
"After examining one by one the different theories, rejecting all other<br>
suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine<br>
animal of enormous power.<br>
<br>
"The great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us.  Soundings<br>
cannot reach them.  What passes in those remote depths--what beings<br>
live, or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the<br>
waters--what is the organisation of these animals, we can scarcely<br>
conjecture.  However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may<br>
modify the form of the dilemma.  Either we do know all the varieties of<br>
beings which people our planet, or we do not.  If we do NOT know them<br>
all--if Nature has still secrets in the deeps for us, nothing is more<br>
conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or<br>
cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organisation<br>
formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an<br>
accident of some sort has brought at long intervals to the upper level<br>
of the ocean.<br>
<br>
"If, on the contrary, we DO know all living kinds, we must necessarily<br>
seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings already<br>
classed; and, in that case, I should be disposed to admit the existence<br>
of a gigantic narwhal.<br>
<br>
"The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea, often attains a length of<br>
sixty feet.  Increase its size fivefold or tenfold, give it strength<br>
proportionate to its size, lengthen its destructive weapons, and you<br>
obtain the animal required.  It will have the proportions determined by<br>
the officers of the Shannon, the instrument required by the perforation<br>
of the Scotia, and the power necessary to pierce the hull of the<br>
steamer.<br>
<br>
"Indeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword, a halberd,<br>
according to the expression of certain naturalists.  The principal tusk<br>
has the hardness of steel.  Some of these tusks have been found buried<br>
in the bodies of whales, which the unicorn always attacks with success.<br>
Others have been drawn out, not without trouble, from the bottoms of<br>
ships, which they had pierced through and through, as a gimlet pierces<br>
a barrel.  The Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris possesses one<br>
of these defensive weapons, two yards and a quarter in length, and<br>
fifteen inches in diameter at the base.<br>
<br>
"Very well! suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal<br>
ten times more powerful; launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour,<br>
and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required.<br>
Until further information, therefore, I shall maintain it to be a<br>
sea-unicorn of colossal dimensions, armed not with a halberd, but with<br>
a real spur, as the armoured frigates, or the `rams' of war, whose<br>
massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time.  Thus<br>
may this puzzling phenomenon be explained, unless there be something<br>
over and above all that one has ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or<br>
experienced; which is just within the bounds of possibility."<br>
<br>
These last words were cowardly on my part; but, up to a certain point,<br>
I wished to shelter my dignity as professor, and not give too much<br>
cause for laughter to the Americans, who laugh well when they do laugh.<br>
I reserved for myself a way of escape.  In effect, however, I admitted<br>
the existence of the "monster." My article was warmly discussed, which<br>
procured it a high reputation.  It rallied round it a certain number of<br>
partisans.  The solution it proposed gave, at least, full liberty to<br>
the imagination.  The human mind delights in grand conceptions of<br><a href="../site3/page3_6768.html">link3_text</a>
supernatural beings.  And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, the<br>
only medium through which these giants (against which terrestrial<br>
animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be<br>
produced or developed.<br>
<br>
The industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from<br>
this point of view.  The Shipping and Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd's<br>
List, the Packet-Boat, and the Maritime and Colonial Review, all papers<br>
devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of<br>
premium, were unanimous on this point.  Public opinion had been<br>
pronounced.  The United States were the first in the field; and in New<br>
York they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this<br>
narwhal.  A frigate of great speed, the Abraham Lincoln, was put in<br>
commission as soon as possible.  The arsenals were opened to Commander<br>
Farragut, who hastened the arming of his frigate; but, as it always<br>
happens, the moment it was decided to pursue the monster, the monster<br>
did not appear.  For two months no one heard it spoken of.  No ship met<br>
with it.  It seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving around<br>
it.  It had been so much talked of, even through the Atlantic cable,<br>
that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on<br>
its passage and was making the most of it.<br>
<br>
So when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign, and provided<br>
with formidable fishing apparatus, no one could tell what course to<br>
pursue.  Impatience grew apace, when, on the 2nd of July, they learned<br>
that a steamer of the line of San Francisco, from California to<br>
Shanghai, had seen the animal three weeks before in the North Pacific<br>
Ocean.  The excitement caused by this news was extreme.  The ship was<br>
revictualled and well stocked with coal.<br>
<br>
Three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left Brooklyn pier, I received a<br>
letter worded as follows:<br>
<br>
To M. ARONNAX, Professor in the Museum of Paris, Fifth Avenue Hotel,<br>
New York.<br>
<br>
SIR,--If you will consent to join the Abraham Lincoln in this<br>
expedition, the Government of the United States will with pleasure see<br>
France represented in the enterprise.  Commander Farragut has a cabin<br>
at your disposal.<br>
<br>
Very cordially yours, J.B. HOBSON, Secretary of Marine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III<br>
<br>
I FORM MY RESOLUTION<br>
<br>
Three seconds before the arrival of J. B. Hobson's letter I no more<br>
thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the<br>
North Sea.  Three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable<br>
Secretary of Marine, I felt that my true vocation, the sole end of my<br>
life, was to chase this disturbing monster and purge it from the world.<br>
<br>
But I had just returned from a fatiguing journey, weary and longing for<br>
repose.  I aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country, my<br>
friends, my little lodging by the Jardin des Plantes, my dear and<br>
precious collections--but nothing could keep me back!  I forgot<br>
all--fatigue, friends and collections--and accepted without hesitation<br>
the offer of the American Government.<br>
<br>
"Besides," thought I, "all roads lead back to Europe; and the unicorn<br>
may be amiable enough to hurry me towards the coast of France.  This<br>
worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the seas of Europe (for<br>
my particular benefit), and I will not bring back less than half a yard<br>
of his ivory halberd to the Museum of Natural History." But in the<br>
meanwhile I must seek this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which,<br>
to return to France, was taking the road to the antipodes.<br>
<br>
"Conseil," I called in an impatient voice.<br>
<br>
Conseil was my servant, a true, devoted Flemish boy, who had<br>
accompanied me in all my travels.  I liked him, and he returned the<br>
liking well.  He was quiet by nature, regular from principle, zealous<br>
from habit, evincing little disturbance at the different surprises of<br>
life, very quick with his hands, and apt at any service required of<br>
him; and, despite his name, never giving advice--even when asked for it.<br>
<br>
Conseil had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led.<br>
Never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey, never<br>
make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might<br>
be, or however far away, whether China or Congo.  Besides all this, he<br>
had good health, which defied all sickness, and solid muscles, but no<br>
nerves; good morals are understood.  This boy was thirty years old, and<br>
his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty.  May I be excused<br>
for saying that I was forty years old?<br>
<br>
But Conseil had one fault:  he was ceremonious to a degree, and would<br>
never speak to me but in the third person, which was sometimes<br>
provoking.<br>
<br>
"Conseil," said I again, beginning with feverish hands to make<br>
preparations for my departure.<br>
<br>
Certainly I was sure of this devoted boy.  As a rule, I never asked him<br>
if it were convenient for him or not to follow me in my travels; but<br>
this time the expedition in question might be prolonged, and the<br>
enterprise might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of<br>
sinking a frigate as easily as a nutshell.  Here there was matter for<br><a href="../site0/page7_4435.html">link4_text</a>
reflection even to the most impassive man in the world.  What would<br>
Conseil say?<br>
<br>
"Conseil," I called a third time.<br>
<br>
Conseil appeared.<br>
<br>
"Did you call, sir?" said he, entering.<br>
<br>
"Yes, my boy; make preparations for me and yourself too.  We leave in<br>
two hours."<br>
<br>
"As you please, sir," replied Conseil, quietly.<br>
<br>
"Not an instant to lose; lock in my trunk all travelling utensils,<br>
coats, shirts, and stockings--without counting, as many as you can, and<br>
make haste."<br>
<br>
"And your collections, sir?" observed Conseil.<br>
<br>
"They will keep them at the hotel."<br>
<br>
"We are not returning to Paris, then?" said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Oh! certainly," I answered, evasively, "by making a curve."<br>
<br>
"Will the curve please you, sir?"<br>
<br>
"Oh! it will be nothing; not quite so direct a road, that is all.  We<br>
take our passage in the Abraham, Lincoln."<br>
<br>
"As you think proper, sir," coolly replied Conseil.<br>
<br>
"You see, my friend, it has to do with the monster--the famous narwhal.<br>
We are going to purge it from the seas.  A glorious mission, but a<br>
dangerous one!  We cannot tell where we may go; these animals can be<br>
very capricious.  But we will go whether or no; we have got a captain<br>
who is pretty wide-awake."<br>
<br>
Our luggage was transported to the deck of the frigate immediately.  I<br>
hastened on board and asked for Commander Farragut.  One of the sailors<br>
conducted me to the poop, where I found myself in the presence of a<br>
good-looking officer, who held out his hand to me.<br>
<br>
"Monsieur Pierre Aronnax?" said he.<br>
<br>
"Himself," replied I. "Commander Farragut?"<br>
<br>
"You are welcome, Professor; your cabin is ready for you."<br>
<br>
I bowed, and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for me.<br>
<br>
The Abraham Lincoln had been well chosen and equipped for her new<br>
destination.  She was a frigate of great speed, fitted with<br>
high-pressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres.<br>
Under this the Abraham Lincoln attained the mean speed of nearly<br>
eighteen knots and a third an hour--a considerable speed, but,<br>
nevertheless, insufficient to grapple with this gigantic cetacean.<br>
<br>
The interior arrangements of the frigate corresponded to its nautical<br>
qualities.  I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was in the after<br>
part, opening upon the gunroom.<br>
<br>
"We shall be well off here," said I to Conseil.<br>
<br>
"As well, by your honour's leave, as a hermit-crab in the shell of a<br>
whelk," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
I left Conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away, and remounted the<br>
poop in order to survey the preparations for departure.<br>
<br>
At that moment Commander Farragut was ordering the last moorings to be<br>
cast loose which held the Abraham Lincoln to the pier of Brooklyn.  So<br>
in a quarter of an hour, perhaps less, the frigate would have sailed<br>
without me.  I should have missed this extraordinary, supernatural, and<br>
incredible expedition, the recital of which may well meet with some<br>
suspicion.<br>
<br>
But Commander Farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the<br>
seas in which the animal had been sighted.  He sent for the engineer.<br>
<br>
"Is the steam full on?" asked he.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir," replied the engineer.<br>
<br>
"Go ahead," cried Commander Farragut.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV<br>
<br>
NED LAND<br>
<br>
Captain Farragut was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate he commanded.<br>
His vessel and he were one.  He was the soul of it.  On the question of<br>
the monster there was no doubt in his mind, and he would not allow the<br>
existence of the animal to be disputed on board.  He believed in it, as<br>
certain good women believe in the leviathan--by faith, not by reason.<br>
The monster did exist, and he had sworn to rid the seas of it.  Either<br>
Captain Farragut would kill the narwhal, or the narwhal would kill the<br><a href="../site4/page4_6754.html">link5_text</a>
captain.  There was no third course.<br>
<br>
The officers on board shared the opinion of their chief.  They were<br>
ever chatting, discussing, and calculating the various chances of a<br>
meeting, watching narrowly the vast surface of the ocean.  More than<br>
one took up his quarters voluntarily in the cross-trees, who would have<br>
cursed such a berth under any other circumstances.  As long as the sun<br>
described its daily course, the rigging was crowded with sailors, whose<br>
feet were burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render<br>
it unbearable; still the Abraham Lincoln had not yet breasted the<br>
suspected waters of the Pacific.  As to the ship's company, they<br>
desired nothing better than to meet the unicorn, to harpoon it, hoist<br>
it on board, and despatch it.  They watched the sea with eager<br>
attention.<br>
<br>
Besides, Captain Farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand<br>
dollars, set apart for whoever should first sight the monster, were he<br>
cabin-boy, common seaman, or officer.<br>
<br>
I leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the Abraham Lincoln.<br>
<br>
For my own part I was not behind the others, and, left to no one my<br>
share of daily observations.  The frigate might have been called the<br>
Argus, for a hundred reasons.  Only one amongst us, Conseil, seemed to<br>
protest by his indifference against the question which so interested us<br>
all, and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on<br>
board.<br>
<br>
I have said that Captain Farragut had carefully provided his ship with<br>
every apparatus for catching the gigantic cetacean.  No whaler had ever<br>
been better armed.  We possessed every known engine, from the harpoon<br>
thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss, and the<br>
explosive balls of the duck-gun.  On the forecastle lay the perfection<br>
of a breech-loading gun, very thick at the breech, and very narrow in<br>
the bore, the model of which had been in the Exhibition of 1867.  This<br>
precious weapon of American origin could throw with ease a conical<br>
projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles.<br>
<br>
Thus the Abraham Lincoln wanted for no means of destruction; and, what<br>
was better still she had on board Ned Land, the prince of harpooners.<br>
<br>
Ned Land was a Canadian, with an uncommon quickness of hand, and who<br>
knew no equal in his dangerous occupation.  Skill, coolness, audacity,<br>
and cunning he possessed in a superior degree, and it must be a cunning<br>
whale to escape the stroke of his harpoon.<br>
<br>
Ned Land was about forty years of age; he was a tall man (more than six<br>
feet high), strongly built, grave and taciturn, occasionally violent,<br>
and very passionate when contradicted.  His person attracted attention,<br>
but above all the boldness of his look, which gave a singular<br>
expression to his face.<br>
<br>
Who calls himself Canadian calls himself French; and, little<br>
communicative as Ned Land was, I must admit that he took a certain<br>
liking for me.  My nationality drew him to me, no doubt.  It was an<br>
opportunity for him to talk, and for me to hear, that old language of<br>
Rabelais, which is still in use in some Canadian provinces.  The<br>
harpooner's family was originally from Quebec, and was already a tribe<br>
of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to France.<br>
<br>
Little by little, Ned Land acquired a taste for chatting, and I loved<br>
to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas.  He related<br>
his fishing, and his combats, with natural poetry of expression; his<br>
recital took the form of an epic poem, and I seemed to be listening to<br>
a Canadian Homer singing the Iliad of the regions of the North.<br>
<br>
I am portraying this hardy companion as I really knew him.  We are old<br>
friends now, united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and<br>
cemented amidst extreme dangers.  Ah, brave Ned!  I ask no more than to<br>
live a hundred years longer, that I may have more time to dwell the<br>
longer on your memory.<br>
<br>
Now, what was Ned Land's opinion upon the question of the marine<br>
monster?  I must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn, and was<br>
the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction.  He<br>
even avoided the subject, which I one day thought it my duty to press<br>
upon him.  One magnificent evening, the 30th July (that is to say,<br>
three weeks after our departure), the frigate was abreast of Cape<br>
Blanc, thirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia.  We had<br>
crossed the tropic of Capricorn, and the Straits of Magellan opened<br>
less than seven hundred miles to the south.  Before eight days were<br>
over the Abraham Lincoln would be ploughing the waters of the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Seated on the poop, Ned Land and I were chatting of one thing and<br>
another as we looked at this mysterious sea, whose great depths had up<br>
to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man.  I naturally led up<br>
the conversation to the giant unicorn, and examined the various chances<br>
of success or failure of the expedition.  But, seeing that Ned Land let<br>
me speak without saying too much himself, I pressed him more closely.<br>
<br>
"Well, Ned," said I, "is it possible that you are not convinced of the<br>
existence of this cetacean that we are following?  Have you any<br>
particular reason for being so incredulous?"<br>
<br>
The harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering,<br>
struck his broad forehead with his hand (a habit of his), as if to<br>
collect himself, and said at last, "Perhaps I have, Mr. Aronnax."<br>
<br>
"But, Ned, you, a whaler by profession, familiarised with all the great<br>
marine mammalia--YOU ought to be the last to doubt under such<br><a href="../site3/page6_1504.html">link6_text</a>
circumstances!"<br>
<br>
"That is just what deceives you, Professor," replied Ned.  "As a whaler<br>
I have followed many a cetacean, harpooned a great number, and killed<br>
several; but, however strong or well-armed they may have been, neither<br>
their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the<br>
iron plates of a steamer."<br>
<br>
"But, Ned, they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have<br>
pierced through and through."<br>
<br>
"Wooden ships--that is possible," replied the Canadian, "but I have<br>
never seen it done; and, until further proof, I deny that whales,<br>
cetaceans, or sea-unicorns could ever produce the effect you describe."<br>
<br>
"Well, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of<br>
facts.  I believe in the existence of a mammal power fully organised,<br>
belonging to the branch of vertebrata, like the whales, the cachalots,<br>
or the dolphins, and furnished with a horn of defence of great<br>
penetrating power."<br>
<br>
"Hum!" said the harpooner, shaking his head with the air of a man who<br>
would not be convinced.<br>
<br>
"Notice one thing, my worthy Canadian," I resumed.  "If such an animal<br>
is in existence, if it inhabits the depths of the ocean, if it<br>
frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water, it<br>
must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would<br>
defy all comparison."<br>
<br>
"And why this powerful organisation?" demanded Ned.<br>
<br>
"Because it requires incalculable strength to keep one's self in these<br>
strata and resist their pressure.  Listen to me.  Let us admit that the<br>
pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of<br>
water thirty-two feet high.  In reality the column of water would be<br>
shorter, as we are speaking of sea water, the density of which is<br>
greater than that of fresh water.  Very well, when you dive, Ned, as<br>
many times 32 feet of water as there are above you, so many times does<br>
your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere, that is to<br>
say, 15 lb. for each square inch of its surface.  It follows, then,<br>
that at 320 feet this pressure equals that of 10 atmospheres, of 100<br>
atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and of 1,000 atmospheres at 32,000 feet,<br>
that is, about 6 miles; which is equivalent to saying that if you could<br>
attain this depth in the ocean, each square three-eighths of an inch of<br>
the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5,600 lb.  Ah! my<br>
brave Ned, do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface<br>
of your body?"<br>
<br>
"I have no idea, Mr. Aronnax."<br>
<br>
"About 6,500; and as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15<br>
lb.  to the square inch, your 6,500 square inches bear at this moment a<br>
pressure of 97,500 lb."<br>
<br>
"Without my perceiving it?"<br>
<br>
"Without your perceiving it.  And if you are not crushed by such a<br>
pressure, it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body<br>
with equal pressure.  Hence perfect equilibrium between the interior<br>
and exterior pressure, which thus neutralise each other, and which<br>
allows you to bear it without inconvenience.  But in the water it is<br>
another thing."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I understand," replied Ned, becoming more attentive; "because the<br>
water surrounds me, but does not penetrate."<br>
<br>
"Precisely, Ned:  so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea you<br>
would undergo a pressure of 97,500 lb.; at 320 feet, ten times that<br>
pressure; at 3,200 feet, a hundred times that pressure; lastly, at<br>
32,000 feet, a thousand times that pressure would be 97,500,000<br>
lb.--that is to say, that you would be flattened as if you had been<br>
drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine!"<br>
<br>
"The devil!" exclaimed Ned.<br>
<br>
"Very well, my worthy harpooner, if some vertebrate, several hundred<br>
yards long, and large in proportion, can maintain itself in such<br>
depths--of those whose surface is represented by millions of square<br>
inches, that is by tens of millions of pounds, we must estimate the<br>
pressure they undergo.  Consider, then, what must be the resistance of<br>
their bony structure, and the strength of their organisation to<br>
withstand such pressure!"<br>
<br>
"Why!" exclaimed Ned Land, "they must be made of iron plates eight<br>
inches thick, like the armoured frigates."<br>
<br>
"As you say, Ned.  And think what destruction such a mass would cause,<br>
if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a<br>
vessel."<br>
<br>
"Yes--certainly--perhaps," replied the Canadian, shaken by these<br>
figures, but not yet willing to give in.<br>
<br>
"Well, have I convinced you?"<br>
<br>
"You have convinced me of one thing, sir, which is that, if such<br>
animals do exist at the bottom of the seas, they must necessarily be as<br>
strong as you say."<br>
<br><a href="../site2/page4_3474.html">link7_text</a>
"But if they do not exist, mine obstinate harpooner, how explain the<br>
accident to the Scotia?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V<br>
<br>
AT A VENTURE<br>
<br>
The voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was for a long time marked by no<br>
special incident.  But one circumstance happened which showed the<br>
wonderful dexterity of Ned Land, and proved what confidence we might<br>
place in him.<br>
<br>
The 30th of June, the frigate spoke some American whalers, from whom we<br>
learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal.  But one of them, the<br>
captain of the Monroe, knowing that Ned Land had shipped on board the<br>
Abraham Lincoln, begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in<br>
sight.  Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave<br>
him permission to go on board the Monroe.  And fate served our Canadian<br>
so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a double<br>
blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other after<br>
some minutes' pursuit.<br>
<br>
Decidedly, if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land's harpoon, I<br>
would not bet in its favour.<br>
<br>
The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great<br>
rapidity.  The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits of<br>
Magellan, level with Cape Vierges.  But Commander Farragut would not<br>
take a tortuous passage, but doubled Cape Horn.<br>
<br>
The ship's crew agreed with him.  And certainly it was possible that<br>
they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass.  Many of the sailors<br>
affirmed that the monster could not pass there, "that he was too big<br>
for that!"<br>
<br>
The 6th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the Abraham<br>
Lincoln, at fifteen miles to the south, doubled the solitary island,<br>
this lost rock at the extremity of the American continent, to which<br>
some Dutch sailors gave the name of their native town, Cape Horn.  The<br>
course was taken towards the north-west, and the next day the screw of<br>
the frigate was at last beating the waters of the Pacific.<br>
<br>
"Keep your eyes open!" called out the sailors.<br>
<br>
And they were opened widely.  Both eyes and glasses, a little dazzled,<br>
it is true, by the prospect of two thousand dollars, had not an<br>
instant's repose.<br>
<br>
I myself, for whom money had no charms, was not the least attentive on<br>
board.  Giving but few minutes to my meals, but a few hours to sleep,<br>
indifferent to either rain or sunshine, I did not leave the poop of the<br>
vessel.  Now leaning on the netting of the forecastle, now on the<br>
taffrail, I devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the<br>
sea as far as the eye could reach; and how often have I shared the<br>
emotion of the majority of the crew, when some capricious whale raised<br>
its black back above the waves!  The poop of the vessel was crowded on<br>
a moment.  The cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers,<br>
each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the<br>
cetacean.  I looked and looked till I was nearly blind, whilst Conseil<br>
kept repeating in a calm voice:<br>
<br>
"If, sir, you would not squint so much, you would see better!"<br>
<br>
But vain excitement!  The Abraham Lincoln checked its speed and made<br>
for the animal signalled, a simple whale, or common cachalot, which<br>
soon disappeared amidst a storm of abuse.<br>
<br>
But the weather was good.  The voyage was being accomplished under the<br>
most favourable auspices.  It was then the bad season in Australia, the<br>
July of that zone corresponding to our January in Europe, but the sea<br>
was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference.<br>
<br>
The 20th of July, the tropic of Capricorn was cut by 105d of longitude,<br>
and the 27th of the same month we crossed the Equator on the 110th<br>
meridian.  This passed, the frigate took a more decided westerly<br>
direction, and scoured the central waters of the Pacific.  Commander<br>
Farragut thought, and with reason, that it was better to remain in deep<br>
water, and keep clear of continents or islands, which the beast itself<br>
seemed to shun (perhaps because there was not enough water for him!<br>
suggested the greater part of the crew). The frigate passed at some<br>
distance from the Marquesas and the Sandwich Islands, crossed the<br>
tropic of Cancer, and made for the China Seas.  We were on the theatre<br>
of the last diversions of the monster:  and, to say truth, we no longer<br>
LIVED on board.  The entire ship's crew were undergoing a nervous<br>
excitement, of which I can give no idea:  they could not eat, they<br>
could not sleep--twenty times a day, a misconception or an optical<br>
illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail, would cause dreadful<br>
perspirations, and these emotions, twenty times repeated, kept us in a<br>
state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable.<br>
<br>
And truly, reaction soon showed itself.  For three months, during which<br>
a day seemed an age, the Abraham Lincoln furrowed all the waters of the<br>
Northern Pacific, running at whales, making sharp deviations from her<br>
course, veering suddenly from one tack to another, stopping suddenly,<br>
putting on steam, and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging<br>
her machinery, and not one point of the Japanese or American coast was<br>
left unexplored.<br>
<br><a href="../site7/page9_7159.html">link8_text</a>
The warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent<br>
detractors.  Reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself, and<br>
certainly, had it not been for the resolute determination on the part<br>
of Captain Farragut, the frigate would have headed due southward.  This<br>
useless search could not last much longer.  The Abraham Lincoln had<br>
nothing to reproach herself with, she had done her best to succeed.<br>
Never had an American ship's crew shown more zeal or patience; its<br>
failure could not be placed to their charge--there remained nothing but<br>
to return.<br>
<br>
This was represented to the commander.  The sailors could not hide<br>
their discontent, and the service suffered.  I will not say there was a<br>
mutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of obstinacy, Captain<br>
Farragut (as Columbus did) asked for three days' patience.  If in three<br>
days the monster did not appear, the man at the helm should give three<br>
turns of the wheel, and the Abraham Lincoln would make for the European<br>
seas.<br>
<br>
This promise was made on the 2nd of November.  It had the effect of<br>
rallying the ship's crew.  The ocean was watched with renewed<br>
attention.  Each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his<br>
remembrance.  Glasses were used with feverish activity.  It was a grand<br>
defiance given to the giant narwhal, and he could scarcely fail to<br>
answer the summons and "appear."<br>
<br>
Two days passed, the steam was at half pressure; a thousand schemes<br>
were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the<br>
animal in case it should be met in those parts.  Large quantities of<br>
bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship, to the great satisfaction<br>
(I must say) of the sharks.  Small craft radiated in all directions<br>
round the Abraham Lincoln as she lay to, and did not leave a spot of<br>
the sea unexplored.  But the night of the 4th of November arrived<br>
without the unveiling of this submarine mystery.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 5th of November, at twelve, the delay would (morally<br>
speaking) expire; after that time, Commander Farragut, faithful to his<br>
promise, was to turn the course to the south-east and abandon for ever<br>
the northern regions of the Pacific.<br>
<br>
The frigate was then in 31° 15' N. lat. and 136° 42' E. long.<br>
The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred miles to<br>
leeward.  Night was approaching.  They had just struck eight bells;<br>
large clouds veiled the face of the moon, then in its first quarter.<br>
The sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel.<br>
<br>
At that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting.<br>
Conseil, standing near me, was looking straight before him.  The crew,<br>
perched in the ratlines, examined the horizon which contracted and<br>
darkened by degrees.  Officers with their night glasses scoured the<br>
growing darkness:  sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the<br>
moon, which darted between two clouds, then all trace of light was lost<br>
in the darkness.<br>
<br>
In looking at Conseil, I could see he was undergoing a little of the<br>
general influence.  At least I thought so.  Perhaps for the first time<br>
his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity.<br>
<br>
"Come, Conseil," said I, "this is the last chance of pocketing the two<br>
thousand dollars."<br>
<br>
"May I be permitted to say, sir," replied Conseil, "that I never<br>
reckoned on getting the prize; and, had the government of the Union<br>
offered a hundred thousand dollars, it would have been none the poorer."<br>
<br>
"You are right, Conseil.  It is a foolish affair after all, and one<br>
upon which we entered too lightly.  What time lost, what useless<br>
emotions!  We should have been back in France six months ago."<br>
<br>
"In your little room, sir," replied Conseil, "and in your museum, sir;<br>
and I should have already classed all your fossils, sir.  And the<br>
Babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the Jardin des<br>
Plantes, and have drawn all the curious people of the capital!"<br>
<br>
"As you say, Conseil.  I fancy we shall run a fair chance of being<br>
laughed at for our pains."<br>
<br>
"That's tolerably certain," replied Conseil, quietly; "I think they<br>
will make fun of you, sir.  And, must I say it----?"<br>
<br>
"Go on, my good friend."<br>
<br>
"Well, sir, you will only get your deserts."<br>
<br>
"Indeed!"<br>
<br>
"When one has the honour of being a _savant_ as you are, sir, one should<br>
not expose one's self to----"<br>
<br>
Conseil had not time to finish his compliment.  In the midst of general<br>
silence a voice had just been heard.  It was the voice of Ned Land<br>
shouting:<br>
<br>
"Look out there!  The very thing we are looking for--on our weather<br>
beam!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI<br>
<br>
AT FULL STEAM<br><a href="../site3/page7_3230.html">link9_text</a>
<br>
At this cry the whole ship's crew hurried towards the<br>
harpooner--commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys; even the<br>
engineers left their engines, and the stokers their furnaces.<br>
<br>
The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate now simply went<br>
on by her own momentum.  The darkness was then profound, and, however<br>
good the Canadian's eyes were, I asked myself how he had managed to<br>
see, and what he had been able to see.  My heart beat as if it would<br>
break.  But Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all perceived the object<br>
he pointed to.  At two cables' length from the Abraham Lincoln, on the<br>
starboard quarter, the sea seemed to be illuminated all over.  It was<br>
not a mere phosphoric phenomenon.  The monster emerged some fathoms<br>
from the water, and then threw out that very intense but mysterious<br>
light mentioned in the report of several captains.  This magnificent<br>
irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great SHINING power.<br>
The luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval, much elongated,<br>
the centre of which condensed a burning heat, whose overpowering<br>
brilliancy died out by successive gradations.<br>
<br>
"It is only a massing of phosphoric particles," cried one of the<br>
officers.<br>
<br>
"No, sir, certainly not," I replied.  "That brightness is of an<br>
essentially electrical nature.  Besides, see, see! it moves; it is<br>
moving forwards, backwards; it is darting towards us!"<br>
<br>
A general cry arose from the frigate.<br>
<br>
"Silence!" said the captain.  "Up with the helm, reverse the engines."<br>
<br>
The steam was shut off, and the Abraham Lincoln, beating to port,<br>
described a semicircle.<br>
<br>
"Right the helm, go ahead," cried the captain.<br>
<br>
These orders were executed, and the frigate moved rapidly from the<br>
burning light.<br>
<br>
I was mistaken.  She tried to sheer off, but the supernatural animal<br>
approached with a velocity double her own.<br>
<br>
We gasped for breath.  Stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and<br>
motionless.  The animal gained on us, sporting with the waves.  It made<br>
the round of the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots, and<br>
enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust.<br>
<br>
Then it moved away two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent track,<br>
like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind.  All<br>
at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain<br>
its momentum, the monster rushed suddenly towards the Abraham Lincoln<br>
with alarming rapidity, stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the<br>
hull, and died out--not diving under the water, for its brilliancy did<br>
not abate--but suddenly, and as if the source of this brilliant<br>
emanation was exhausted.  Then it reappeared on the other side of the<br>
vessel, as if it had turned and slid under the hull.  Any moment a<br>
collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us.<br>
However, I was astonished at the manoeuvres of the frigate.  She fled<br>
and did not attack.<br>
<br>
On the captain's face, generally so impassive, was an expression of<br>
unaccountable astonishment.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Aronnax," he said, "I do not know with what formidable being I<br>
have to deal, and I will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst<br>
of this darkness.  Besides, how attack this unknown thing, how defend<br>
one's self from it?  Wait for daylight, and the scene will change."<br>
<br>
"You have no further doubt, captain, of the nature of the animal?"<br>
<br>
"No, sir; it is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an electric one."<br>
<br>
"Perhaps," added I, "one can only approach it with a torpedo."<br>
<br>
"Undoubtedly," replied the captain, "if it possesses such dreadful<br>
power, it is the most terrible animal that ever was created.  That is<br>

The crew were on their feet all night.  No one thought of sleep.  The<br>

a deafening whistling was heard, like that produced by a body of water<br>
rushing with great violence.<br>
<br>
The captain, Ned Land, and I were then on the poop, eagerly peering<br>
through the profound darkness.<br>
<br>
"Ned Land," asked the commander, "you have often heard the roaring of<br>
whales?"<br>
<br>
"Often, sir; but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two<br>
thousand dollars.  If I can only approach within four harpoons' length<br>
of it!"<br>
<br>
"But to approach it," said the commander, "I ought to put a whaler at<br><a href="../site8/page8_3188.html">link10_text</a>
