shoulders an object of an oblong shape.<br>
<br>
We occupied, in this place, the centre of a vast glade surrounded by<br>
the lofty foliage of the submarine forest.  Our lamps threw over this<br>
place a sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows on<br>
the ground.  At the end of the glade the darkness increased, and was<br>
only relieved by little sparks reflected by the points of coral.<br>
<br>
Ned Land and Conseil were near me.  We watched, and I thought I was<br>
going to witness a strange scene.  On observing the ground, I saw that<br>
it was raised in certain places by slight excrescences encrusted with<br>
limy deposits, and disposed with a regularity that betrayed the hand of<br>
man.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the glade, on a pedestal of rocks roughly piled up,<br>
stood a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one might have<br>
thought were made of petrified blood.  Upon a sign from Captain Nemo<br>
one of the men advanced; and at some feet from the cross he began to<br>
dig a hole with a pickaxe that he took from his belt.  I understood<br>
all!  This glade was a cemetery, this hole a tomb, this oblong object<br>
the body of the man who had died in the night!  The Captain and his men<br>
had come to bury their companion in this general resting-place, at the<br>
bottom of this inaccessible ocean!<br>
<br>
The grave was being dug slowly; the fish fled on all sides while their<br>
retreat was being thus disturbed; I heard the strokes of the pickaxe,<br>
which sparkled when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of the<br>
waters.  The hole was soon large and deep enough to receive the body.<br>
Then the bearers approached; the body, enveloped in a tissue of white<br>
linen, was lowered into the damp grave.  Captain Nemo, with his arms<br>
crossed on his breast, and all the friends of him who had loved them,<br>
knelt in prayer.<br>
<br>
The grave was then filled in with the rubbish taken from the ground,<br>
which formed a slight mound.  When this was done, Captain Nemo and his<br>
men rose; then, approaching the grave, they knelt again, and all<br>
extended their hands in sign of a last adieu.  Then the funeral<br>
procession returned to the Nautilus, passing under the arches of the<br>
forest, in the midst of thickets, along the coral bushes, and still on<br>
the ascent.  At last the light of the ship appeared, and its luminous<br>
track guided us to the Nautilus.  At one o'clock we had returned.<br>
<br>
As soon as I had changed my clothes I went up on to the platform, and,<br>
a prey to conflicting emotions, I sat down near the binnacle.  Captain<br>
Nemo joined me.  I rose and said to him:<br>
<br>
"So, as I said he would, this man died in the night?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, M. Aronnax."<br>
<br>
"And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, forgotten by all else, but not by us.  We dug the grave, and the<br>
polypi undertake to seal our dead for eternity." And, burying his face<br>
quickly in his hands, he tried in vain to suppress a sob.  Then he<br>
added:  "Our peaceful cemetery is there, some hundred feet below the<br>
surface of the waves."<br>
<br>
"Your dead sleep quietly, at least, Captain, out of the reach of<br>
sharks."<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir, of sharks and men," gravely replied the Captain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PART TWO<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I<br>
<br>
THE INDIAN OCEAN<br>
<br>
We now come to the second part of our journey under the sea.  The first<br>
ended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such a<br>
deep impression on my mind.  Thus, in the midst of this great sea,<br>
Captain Nemo's life was passing, even to his grave, which he had<br>
prepared in one of its deepest abysses.  There, not one of the ocean's<br>
monsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew of the Nautilus, of<br>
those friends riveted to each other in death as in life.  "Nor any man,<br>
either," had added the Captain.  Still the same fierce, implacable<br>
defiance towards human society!<br>
<br>
I could no longer content myself with the theory which satisfied<br>
Conseil.<br>
<br>
That worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the Commander of the Nautilus<br>
one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt for<br>
indifference.  For him, he was a misunderstood genius who, tired of<br>
earth's deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, where<br>
he might follow his instincts freely.  To my mind, this explains but<br>
one side of Captain Nemo's character.  Indeed, the mystery of that last<br>
night during which we had been chained in prison, the sleep, and the<br>
precaution so violently taken by the Captain of snatching from my eyes<br>
the glass I had raised to sweep the horizon, the mortal wound of the<br>
man, due to an unaccountable shock of the Nautilus, all put me on a new<br>
track.  No; Captain Nemo was not satisfied with shunning man.  His<br>
formidable apparatus not only suited his instinct of freedom, but<br>
perhaps also the design of some terrible retaliation.<br>
<br>
At this moment nothing is clear to me; I catch but a glimpse of light<br>
amidst all the darkness, and I must confine myself to writing as events<br>
shall dictate.<br>
<br>
That day, the 24th of January, 1868, at noon, the second officer came<br>
to take the altitude of the sun.  I mounted the platform, lit a cigar,<br>
and watched the operation.  It seemed to me that the man did not<br>
understand French; for several times I made remarks in a loud voice,<br>
which must have drawn from him some involuntary sign of attention, if<br>
he had understood them; but he remained undisturbed and dumb.<br>
<br>
As he was taking observations with the sextant, one of the sailors of<br>
the Nautilus (the strong man who had accompanied us on our first<br>
submarine excursion to the Island of Crespo) came to clean the glasses<br>
of the lantern.  I examined the fittings of the apparatus, the strength<br>
of which was increased a hundredfold by lenticular rings, placed<br>
similar to those in a lighthouse, and which projected their brilliance<br>
in a horizontal plane.  The electric lamp was combined in such a way as<br>
to give its most powerful light.  Indeed, it was produced in vacuo,<br>
which insured both its steadiness and its intensity.  This vacuum<br>
economised the graphite points between which the luminous arc was<br>
developed--an important point of economy for Captain Nemo, who could<br>
not easily have replaced them; and under these conditions their waste<br>
was imperceptible.  When the Nautilus was ready to continue its<br>
submarine journey, I went down to the saloon.  The panel was closed,<br>
and the course marked direct west.<br>
<br>
We were furrowing the waters of the Indian Ocean, a vast liquid plain,<br>
with a surface of 1,200,000,000 of acres, and whose waters are so clear<br>
and transparent that any one leaning over them would turn giddy.  The<br>
Nautilus usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep.  We<br>
went on so for some days.  To anyone but myself, who had a great love<br>
for the sea, the hours would have seemed long and monotonous; but the<br>
daily walks on the platform, when I steeped myself in the reviving air<br>
of the ocean, the sight of the rich waters through the windows of the<br>
saloon, the books in the library, the compiling of my memoirs, took up<br>
all my time, and left me not a moment of ennui or weariness.<br>
<br>
For some days we saw a great number of aquatic birds, sea-mews or<br>
gulls.  Some were cleverly killed and, prepared in a certain way, made<br>
very acceptable water-game. Amongst large-winged birds, carried a long<br>
distance from all lands and resting upon the waves from the fatigue of<br>
their flight, I saw some magnificent albatrosses, uttering discordant<br>
cries like the braying of an ass, and birds belonging to the family of<br>
the long-wings.<br>
<br>
As to the fish, they always provoked our admiration when we surprised<br>
the secrets of their aquatic life through the open panels.  I saw many<br>
kinds which I never before had a chance of observing.<br><a href="../site7/page3_8282.html">link1_text</a>
<br>
I shall notice chiefly ostracions peculiar to the Red Sea, the Indian<br>
Ocean, and that part which washes the coast of tropical America. These<br>
fishes, like the tortoise, the armadillo, the sea-hedgehog, and the<br>
Crustacea, are protected by a breastplate which is neither chalky nor<br>
stony, but real bone. In some it takes the form of a solid triangle, in<br>
others of a solid quadrangle. Amongst the triangular I saw some an inch<br>
and a half in length, with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour;<br>
they are brown at the tail, and yellow at the fins, and I recommend<br>
their introduction into fresh water, to which a certain number of<br>
sea-fish easily accustom themselves. I would also mention quadrangular<br>
ostracions, having on the back four large tubercles; some dotted over<br>
with white spots on the lower part of the body, and which may be tamed<br>
like birds; trigons provided with spikes formed by the lengthening of<br>
their bony shell, and which, from their strange gruntings, are called<br>
"seapigs"; also dromedaries with large humps in the shape of a cone,<br>
whose flesh is very tough and leathery.<br>
<br>
I now borrow from the daily notes of Master Conseil. "Certain fish of<br>
the genus petrodon peculiar to those seas, with red backs and white<br>
chests, which are distinguished by three rows of longitudinal<br>
filaments; and some electrical, seven inches long, decked in the<br>
liveliest colours.  Then, as specimens of other kinds, some ovoides,<br>
resembling an egg of a dark brown colour, marked with white bands, and<br>
without tails; diodons, real sea-porcupines, furnished with spikes, and<br>
capable of swelling in such a way as to look like cushions bristling<br>
with darts; hippocampi, common to every ocean; some pegasi with<br>
lengthened snouts, which their pectoral fins, being much elongated and<br>
formed in the shape of wings, allow, if not to fly, at least to shoot<br>
into the air; pigeon spatulae, with tails covered with many rings of<br>
shell; macrognathi with long jaws, an excellent fish, nine inches long,<br>
and bright with most agreeable colours; pale-coloured calliomores, with<br>
rugged heads; and plenty of chaetpdons, with long and tubular muzzles,<br>
which kill insects by shooting them, as from an air-gun, with a single<br>
drop of water. These we may call the flycatchers of the seas.<br>
<br>
"In the eighty-ninth genus of fishes, classed by Lacepede, belonging to<br>
the second lower class of bony, characterised by opercules and<br>
bronchial membranes, I remarked the scorpaena, the head of which is<br>
furnished with spikes, and which has but one dorsal fin; these<br>
creatures are covered, or not, with little shells, according to the<br>
sub-class to which they belong. The second sub-class gives us specimens<br>
of didactyles fourteen or fifteen inches in length, with yellow rays,<br>
and heads of a most fantastic appearance. As to the first sub-class, it<br>
gives several specimens of that singular looking fish appropriately<br>
called a 'seafrog,' with large head, sometimes pierced with holes,<br>
sometimes swollen with protuberances, bristling with spikes, and<br>
covered with tubercles; it has irregular and hideous horns; its body<br>
and tail are covered with callosities; its sting makes a dangerous<br>
wound; it is both repugnant and horrible to look at."<br>
<br>
From the 21st to the 23rd of January the Nautilus went at the rate of<br>
two hundred and fifty leagues in twenty-four hours, being five hundred<br>
and forty miles, or twenty-two miles an hour.  If we recognised so many<br>
different varieties of fish, it was because, attracted by the electric<br>
light, they tried to follow us; the greater part, however, were soon<br>
distanced by our speed, though some kept their place in the waters of<br>
the Nautilus for a time.  The morning of the 24th, in 12° 5' S.<br>
lat., and 94° 33' long., we observed Keeling Island, a coral<br>
formation, planted with magnificent cocos, and which had been visited<br>
by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy.  The Nautilus skirted the shores of<br>
this desert island for a little distance.  Its nets brought up numerous<br>
specimens of polypi and curious shells of mollusca.  Some precious<br>
productions of the species of delphinulae enriched the treasures of<br>
Captain Nemo, to which I added an astraea punctifera, a kind of<br>
parasite polypus often found fixed to a shell.<br>
<br>
Soon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon, and our course was<br>
directed to the north-west in the direction of the Indian Peninsula.<br>
<br>
From Keeling Island our course was slower and more variable, often<br>
taking us into great depths.  Several times they made use of the<br>
inclined planes, which certain internal levers placed obliquely to the<br>
waterline.  In that way we went about two miles, but without ever<br>
obtaining the greatest depths of the Indian Sea, which soundings of<br>
seven thousand fathoms have never reached.  As to the temperature of<br>
the lower strata, the thermometer invariably indicated 4° above<br>
zero.  I only observed that in the upper regions the water was always<br>
colder in the high levels than at the surface of the sea.<br>
<br>
On the 25th of January the ocean was entirely deserted; the Nautilus<br>
passed the day on the surface, beating the waves with its powerful<br>
screw and making them rebound to a great height.  Who under such<br>
circumstances would not have taken it for a gigantic cetacean?  Three<br>
parts of this day I spent on the platform.  I watched the sea.  Nothing<br>
on the horizon, till about four o'clock a steamer running west on our<br>
counter.  Her masts were visible for an instant, but she could not see<br>
the Nautilus, being too low in the water.  I fancied this steamboat<br>
belonged to the P.O. Company, which runs from Ceylon to Sydney,<br>
touching at King George's Point and Melbourne.<br>
<br>
At five o'clock in the evening, before that fleeting twilight which<br>
binds night to day in tropical zones, Conseil and I were astonished by<br>
a curious spectacle.<br>
<br>
It was a shoal of argonauts travelling along on the surface of the<br>
ocean.  We could count several hundreds.  They belonged to the tubercle<br>
kind which are peculiar to the Indian seas.<br>
<br>
These graceful molluscs moved backwards by means of their locomotive<br>
tube, through which they propelled the water already drawn in.  Of<br>
their eight tentacles, six were elongated, and stretched out floating<br>
on the water, whilst the other two, rolled up flat, were spread to the<br>
wing like a light sail.  I saw their spiral-shaped and fluted shells,<br>
which Cuvier justly compares to an elegant skiff.  A boat indeed!  It<br>
bears the creature which secretes it without its adhering to it.<br>
<br>
For nearly an hour the Nautilus floated in the midst of this shoal of<br>
molluscs.  Then I know not what sudden fright they took.  But as if at<br>
a signal every sail was furled, the arms folded, the body drawn in, the<br>
shells turned over, changing their centre of gravity, and the whole<br>
fleet disappeared under the waves.  Never did the ships of a squadron<br>
manoeuvre with more unity.<br>
<br>
At that moment night fell suddenly, and the reeds, scarcely raised by<br>
the breeze, lay peaceably under the sides of the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
The next day, 26th of January, we cut the equator at the eighty-second<br>
meridian and entered the northern hemisphere.  During the day a<br>
formidable troop of sharks accompanied us, terrible creatures, which<br>
multiply in these seas and make them very dangerous.  They were<br>
"cestracio philippi" sharks, with brown backs and whitish bellies,<br>
armed with eleven rows of teeth--eyed sharks--their throat being marked<br>
with a large black spot surrounded with white like an eye.  There were<br>
also some Isabella sharks, with rounded snouts marked with dark spots.<br>
These powerful creatures often hurled themselves at the windows of the<br>
saloon with such violence as to make us feel very insecure.  At such<br>
times Ned Land was no longer master of himself.  He wanted to go to the<br>
surface and harpoon the monsters, particularly certain smooth-hound<br>
sharks, whose mouth is studded with teeth like a mosaic; and large<br>
tiger-sharks nearly six yards long, the last named of which seemed to<br>
excite him more particularly.  But the Nautilus, accelerating her<br>
speed, easily left the most rapid of them behind.<br>
<br>
The 27th of January, at the entrance of the vast Bay of Bengal, we met<br>
repeatedly a forbidding spectacle, dead bodies floating on the surface<br>
of the water.  They were the dead of the Indian villages, carried by<br>
the Ganges to the level of the sea, and which the vultures, the only<br>
undertakers of the country, had not been able to devour.  But the<br>
sharks did not fail to help them at their funeral work.<br>
<br>
About seven o'clock in the evening, the Nautilus, half-immersed, was<br>
sailing in a sea of milk.  At first sight the ocean seemed lactified.<br>
Was it the effect of the lunar rays?  No; for the moon, scarcely two<br>
days old, was still lying hidden under the horizon in the rays of the<br>
sun.  The whole sky, though lit by the sidereal rays, seemed black by<br>
contrast with the whiteness of the waters.<br>
<br><a href="../site7/page8_6796.html">link2_text</a>
Conseil could not believe his eyes, and questioned me as to the cause<br>
of this strange phenomenon.  Happily I was able to answer him.<br>
<br>
"It is called a milk sea," I explained.  "A large extent of white<br>
wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of Amboyna, and in these parts<br>
of the sea."<br>
<br>
"But, sir," said Conseil, "can you tell me what causes such an effect?<br>
for I suppose the water is not really turned into milk."<br>
<br>
"No, my boy; and the whiteness which surprises you is caused only by<br>
the presence of myriads of infusoria, a sort of luminous little worm,<br>
gelatinous and without colour, of the thickness of a hair, and whose<br>
length is not more than seven-thousandths of an inch.  These insects<br>
adhere to one another sometimes for several leagues."<br>
<br>
"Several leagues!" exclaimed Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Yes, my boy; and you need not try to compute the number of these<br>
infusoria.  You will not be able, for, if I am not mistaken, ships have<br>
floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles."<br>
<br>
Towards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual colour; but behind<br>
us, even to the limits of the horizon, the sky reflected the whitened<br>
waves, and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague<br>
glimmerings of an aurora borealis.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II<br>
<br>
A NOVEL PROPOSAL OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S<br>
<br>
On the 28th of February, when at noon the Nautilus came to the surface<br>
of the sea, in 9° 4' N. lat., there was land in sight about eight<br>
miles to westward.  The first thing I noticed was a range of mountains<br>
about two thousand feet high, the shapes of which were most capricious.<br>
On taking the bearings, I knew that we were nearing the island of<br>
Ceylon, the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the Indian Peninsula.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo and his second appeared at this moment.  The Captain<br>
glanced at the map.  Then turning to me, said:<br>
<br>
"The Island of Ceylon, noted for its pearl-fisheries. Would you like to<br>
visit one of them, M. Aronnax?"<br>
<br>
"Certainly, Captain."<br>
<br>
"Well, the thing is easy.  Though, if we see the fisheries, we shall<br>
not see the fishermen.  The annual exportation has not yet begun.<br>
Never mind, I will give orders to make for the Gulf of Manaar, where we<br>
shall arrive in the night."<br>
<br>
The Captain said something to his second, who immediately went out.<br>
Soon the Nautilus returned to her native element, and the manometer<br>
showed that she was about thirty feet deep.<br>
<br>
"Well, sir," said Captain Nemo, "you and your companions shall visit<br>
the Bank of Manaar, and if by chance some fisherman should be there, we<br>
shall see him at work."<br>
<br>
"Agreed, Captain!"<br>
<br>
"By the bye, M. Aronnax you are not afraid of sharks?"<br>
<br>
"Sharks!" exclaimed I.<br>
<br>
This question seemed a very hard one.<br>
<br>
"Well?" continued Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
"I admit, Captain, that I am not yet very familiar with that kind of<br>
fish."<br>
<br>
"We are accustomed to them," replied Captain Nemo, "and in time you<br>
will be too.  However, we shall be armed, and on the road we may be<br>
able to hunt some of the tribe.  It is interesting.  So, till<br>
to-morrow, sir, and early."<br>
<br>
This said in a careless tone, Captain Nemo left the saloon.  Now, if<br>
you were invited to hunt the bear in the mountains of Switzerland, what<br>
would you say?<br>
<br>
"Very well! to-morrow we will go and hunt the bear." If you were asked<br>
to hunt the lion in the plains of Atlas, or the tiger in the Indian<br>
jungles, what would you say?<br>
<br>
"Ha! ha! it seems we are going to hunt the tiger or the lion!" But when<br>
you are invited to hunt the shark in its natural element, you would<br>
perhaps reflect before accepting the invitation.  As for myself, I<br>
passed my hand over my forehead, on which stood large drops of cold<br>
perspiration.  "Let us reflect," said I, "and take our time.  Hunting<br>
otters in submarine forests, as we did in the Island of Crespo, will<br>
pass; but going up and down at the bottom of the sea, where one is<br>
almost certain to meet sharks, is quite another thing!  I know well<br>
that in certain countries, particularly in the Andaman Islands, the<br>
negroes never hesitate to attack them with a dagger in one hand and a<br>
running noose in the other; but I also know that few who affront those<br>
creatures ever return alive.  However, I am not a negro, and if I were<br>
I think a little hesitation in this case would not be ill-timed."<br>
<br>
At this moment Conseil and the Canadian entered, quite composed, and<br>
even joyous.  They knew not what awaited them.<br>
<br>
"Faith, sir," said Ned Land, "your Captain Nemo--the devil take<br>
him!--has just made us a very pleasant offer."<br>
<br>
"Ah!" said I, "you know?"<br>
<br>
"If agreeable to you, sir," interrupted Conseil, "the commander of the<br>
Nautilus has invited us to visit the magnificent Ceylon fisheries<br>
to-morrow, in your company; he did it kindly, and behaved like a real<br>
gentleman."<br>
<br>
"He said nothing more?"<br>
<br>
"Nothing more, sir, except that he had already spoken to you of this<br>
little walk."<br>
<br>
"Sir," said Conseil, "would you give us some details of the pearl<br>
fishery?"<br>
<br>
"As to the fishing itself," I asked, "or the incidents, which?"<br>
<br>
"On the fishing," replied the Canadian; "before entering upon the<br>
ground, it is as well to know something about it."<br>
<br>
"Very well; sit down, my friends, and I will teach you."<br>
<br>
Ned and Conseil seated themselves on an ottoman, and the first thing<br>
the Canadian asked was:<br>
<br>
"Sir, what is a pearl?"<br>
<br>
"My worthy Ned," I answered, "to the poet, a pearl is a tear of the<br>
sea; to the Orientals, it is a drop of dew solidified; to the ladies,<br>
it is a jewel of an oblong shape, of a brilliancy of mother-of-pearl<br>
substance, which they wear on their fingers, their necks, or their<br>
ears; for the chemist it is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of<br>
lime, with a little gelatine; and lastly, for naturalists, it is simply<br>
a morbid secretion of the organ that produces the mother-of-pearl<br>
amongst certain bivalves."<br>
<br>
"Branch of molluscs," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Precisely so, my learned Conseil; and, amongst these testacea the<br>
earshell, the tridacnae, the turbots, in a word, all those which<br>
secrete mother-of-pearl, that is, the blue, bluish, violet, or white<br><a href="../site5/page1_5432.html">link3_text</a>
substance which lines the interior of their shells, are capable of<br>
producing pearls."<br>
<br>
"Mussels too?" asked the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Yes, mussels of certain waters in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Saxony,<br>
Bohemia, and France."<br>
<br>
"Good!  For the future I shall pay attention," replied the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"But," I continued, "the particular mollusc which secretes the pearl is<br>
the pearl-oyster, the meleagrina margaritiferct, that precious<br>
pintadine. The pearl is nothing but a nacreous formation, deposited in<br>
a globular form, either adhering to the oyster shell, or buried in the<br>
folds of the creature. On the shell it is fast; in the flesh it is<br>
loose; but always has for a kernel a small hard substance, may be a<br>
barren egg, may be a grain of sand, around which the pearly matter<br>
deposits itself year after year successively, and by thin concentric<br>
layers."<br>
<br>
"Are many pearls found in the same oyster?" asked Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Yes, my boy.  Some are a perfect casket.  One oyster has been<br>
mentioned, though I allow myself to doubt it, as having contained no<br>
less than a hundred and fifty sharks."<br>
<br>
"A hundred and fifty sharks!" exclaimed Ned Land.<br>
<br>
"Did I say sharks?" said I hurriedly.  "I meant to say a hundred and<br>
fifty pearls.  Sharks would not be sense."<br>
<br>
"Certainly not," said Conseil; "but will you tell us now by what means<br>
they extract these pearls?"<br>
<br>
"They proceed in various ways.  When they adhere to the shell, the<br>
fishermen often pull them off with pincers; but the most common way is<br>
to lay the oysters on mats of the seaweed which covers the banks.  Thus<br>
they die in the open air; and at the end of ten days they are in a<br>
forward state of decomposition.  They are then plunged into large<br>
reservoirs of sea-water; then they are opened and washed."<br>
<br>
"The price of these pearls varies according to their size?" asked<br>
Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Not only according to their size," I answered, "but also according to<br>
their shape, their water (that is, their colour), and their lustre:<br>
that is, that bright and diapered sparkle which makes them so charming<br>
to the eye.  The most beautiful are called virgin pearls, or paragons.<br>
They are formed alone in the tissue of the mollusc, are white, often<br>
opaque, and sometimes have the transparency of an opal; they are<br>
generally round or oval.  The round are made into bracelets, the oval<br>
into pendants, and, being more precious, are sold singly.  Those<br>
adhering to the shell of the oyster are more irregular in shape, and<br>
are sold by weight.  Lastly, in a lower order are classed those small<br>
pearls known under the name of seed-pearls; they are sold by measure,<br>
and are especially used in embroidery for church ornaments."<br>
<br>
"But," said Conseil, "is this pearl-fishery dangerous?"<br>
<br>
"No," I answered, quickly; "particularly if certain precautions are<br>
taken."<br>
<br>
"What does one risk in such a calling?" said Ned Land, "the swallowing<br>
of some mouthfuls of sea-water?"<br>
<br>
"As you say, Ned.  By the bye," said I, trying to take Captain Nemo's<br>
careless tone, "are you afraid of sharks, brave Ned?"<br>
<br>
"I!" replied the Canadian; "a harpooner by profession?  It is my trade<br>
to make light of them."<br>
<br>
"But," said I, "it is not a question of fishing for them with an<br>
iron-swivel, hoisting them into the vessel, cutting off their tails<br>
with a blow of a chopper, ripping them up, and throwing their heart<br>
into the sea!"<br>
<br>
"Then, it is a question of----"<br>
<br>
"Precisely."<br>
<br>
"In the water?"<br>
<br>
"In the water."<br>
<br>
"Faith, with a good harpoon!  You know, sir, these sharks are<br>
ill-fashioned beasts.  They turn on their bellies to seize you, and in<br>
that time----"<br>
<br>
Ned Land had a way of saying "seize" which made my blood run cold.<br>
<br>
"Well, and you, Conseil, what do you think of sharks?"<br>
<br>
"Me!" said Conseil.  "I will be frank, sir."<br>
<br>
"So much the better," thought I.<br>
<br>
"If you, sir, mean to face the sharks, I do not see why your faithful<br>
servant should not face them with you."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III<br>
<br>
A PEARL OF TEN MILLIONS<br>
<br>
The next morning at four o'clock I was awakened by the steward whom<br>
Captain Nemo had placed at my service.  I rose hurriedly, dressed, and<br>
went into the saloon.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo was awaiting me.<br>
<br>
"M. Aronnax," said he, "are you ready to start?"<br>
<br>
"I am ready."<br>
<br>
"Then please to follow me."<br>
<br>
"And my companions, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"They have been told and are waiting."<br>
<br>
"Are we not to put on our diver's dresses?" asked I.<br>
<br>
"Not yet.  I have not allowed the Nautilus to come too near this coast,<br>
and we are some distance from the Manaar Bank; but the boat is ready,<br>
and will take us to the exact point of disembarking, which will save us<br>
a long way.  It carries our diving apparatus, which we will put on when<br>
we begin our submarine journey."<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo conducted me to the central staircase, which led on the<br>
platform.  Ned and Conseil were already there, delighted at the idea of<br>
the "pleasure party" which was preparing.  Five sailors from the<br>
Nautilus, with their oars, waited in the boat, which had been made fast<br>
against the side.<br>
<br>
The night was still dark.  Layers of clouds covered the sky, allowing<br>
but few stars to be seen.  I looked on the side where the land lay, and<br>
saw nothing but a dark line enclosing three parts of the horizon, from<br>
south-west to north west.  The Nautilus, having returned during the<br>
night up the western coast of Ceylon, was now west of the bay, or<br>
rather gulf, formed by the mainland and the Island of Manaar.  There,<br>
under the dark waters, stretched the pintadine bank, an inexhaustible<br>
field of pearls, the length of which is more than twenty miles.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo, Ned Land, Conseil, and I took our places in the stern of<br>
the boat.  The master went to the tiller; his four companions leaned on<br>
their oars, the painter was cast off, and we sheered off.<br>
<br><a href="../site7/page7_2902.html">link4_text</a>
The boat went towards the south; the oarsmen did not hurry.  I noticed<br>
that their strokes, strong in the water, only followed each other every<br>
ten seconds, according to the method generally adopted in the navy.<br>
Whilst the craft was running by its own velocity, the liquid drops<br>
struck the dark depths of the waves crisply like spats of melted lead.<br>
A little billow, spreading wide, gave a slight roll to the boat, and<br>
some samphire reeds flapped before it.<br>
<br>
We were silent.  What was Captain Nemo thinking of?  Perhaps of the<br>
land he was approaching, and which he found too near to him, contrary<br>
to the Canadian's opinion, who thought it too far off.  As to Conseil,<br>
he was merely there from curiosity.<br>
<br>
About half-past five the first tints on the horizon showed the upper<br>
line of coast more distinctly.  Flat enough in the east, it rose a<br>
little to the south.  Five miles still lay between us, and it was<br>
indistinct owing to the mist on the water.  At six o'clock it became<br>
suddenly daylight, with that rapidity peculiar to tropical regions,<br>
which know neither dawn nor twilight.  The solar rays pierced the<br>
curtain of clouds, piled up on the eastern horizon, and the radiant orb<br>
rose rapidly.  I saw land distinctly, with a few trees scattered here<br>
and there.  The boat neared Manaar Island, which was rounded to the<br>
south.  Captain Nemo rose from his seat and watched the sea.<br>
<br>
At a sign from him the anchor was dropped, but the chain scarcely ran,<br>
for it was little more than a yard deep, and this spot was one of the<br>
highest points of the bank of pintadines.<br>
<br>
"Here we are, M. Aronnax," said Captain Nemo.  "You see that enclosed<br>
bay?  Here, in a month will be assembled the numerous fishing boats of<br>
the exporters, and these are the waters their divers will ransack so<br>
boldly.  Happily, this bay is well situated for that kind of fishing.<br>
It is sheltered from the strongest winds; the sea is never very rough<br>
here, which makes it favourable for the diver's work.  We will now put<br>
on our dresses, and begin our walk."<br>
<br>
I did not answer, and, while watching the suspected waves, began with<br>
the help of the sailors to put on my heavy sea-dress. Captain Nemo and<br>
my companions were also dressing.  None of the Nautilus men were to<br>
accompany us on this new excursion.<br>
<br>
Soon we were enveloped to the throat in india-rubber clothing; the air<br>
apparatus fixed to our backs by braces.  As to the Ruhmkorff apparatus,<br>
there was no necessity for it.  Before putting my head into the copper<br>
cap, I had asked the question of the Captain.<br>
<br>
"They would be useless," he replied.  "We are going to no great depth,<br>
and the solar rays will be enough to light our walk.  Besides, it would<br>
not be prudent to carry the electric light in these waters; its<br>
brilliancy might attract some of the dangerous inhabitants of the coast<br>
most inopportunely."<br>
<br>
As Captain Nemo pronounced these words, I turned to Conseil and Ned<br>
Land.  But my two friends had already encased their heads in the metal<br>
cap, and they could neither hear nor answer.<br>
<br>
One last question remained to ask of Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
"And our arms?" asked I; "our guns?"<br>
<br>
"Guns!  What for?  Do not mountaineers attack the bear with a dagger in<br>
their hand, and is not steel surer than lead?  Here is a strong blade;<br>
put it in your belt, and we start."<br>
<br>
I looked at my companions; they were armed like us, and, more than<br>
that, Ned Land was brandishing an enormous harpoon, which he had placed<br>
in the boat before leaving the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
Then, following the Captain's example, I allowed myself to be dressed<br>
in the heavy copper helmet, and our reservoirs of air were at once in<br>
activity.  An instant after we were landed, one after the other, in<br>
about two yards of water upon an even sand.  Captain Nemo made a sign<br>
with his hand, and we followed him by a gentle declivity till we<br>
disappeared under the waves.<br>
<br>
Over our feet, like coveys of snipe in a bog, rose shoals of fish, of<br>
the genus monoptera, which have no other fins but their tail. I<br>
recognized the Javanese, a real serpent two and a half feet long, of a<br>
livid colour underneath, and which might easily be mistaken for a<br>
conger eel if it were not for the golden stripes on its side. In the<br>
genus stromateus, whose bodies are very flat and oval, I saw some of<br>
the most brilliant colours, carrying their dorsal fin like a scythe; an<br>
excellent eating fish, which, dried and pickled, is known by the name<br>
of Karawade; then some tranquebars, belonging to the genus<br>
apsiphoroides, whose body is covered with a shell cuirass of eight<br>
longitudinal plates.<br>
<br>
The heightening sun lit the mass of waters more and more. The soil<br>
changed by degrees. To the fine sand succeeded a perfect causeway of<br>
boulders, covered with a carpet of molluscs and zoophytes. Amongst the<br>
specimens of these branches I noticed some placenae, with thin unequal<br>
shells, a kind of ostracion peculiar to the Red Sea and the Indian<br>
Ocean; some orange lucinae with rounded shells; rockfish three feet and<br>
a half long, which raised themselves under the waves like hands ready<br>
to seize one. There were also some panopyres, slightly luminous; and<br>
lastly, some oculines, like magnificent fans, forming one of the<br>
richest vegetations of these seas.<br>
<br>
In the midst of these living plants, and under the arbours of the<br>
hydrophytes, were layers of clumsy articulates, particularly some<br>
raninae, whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle; and some<br>
horrible looking parthenopes.<br>
<br>
At about seven o'clock we found ourselves at last surveying the<br>
oyster-banks on which the pearl-oysters are reproduced by millions.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo pointed with his hand to the enormous heap of oysters; and<br>
I could well understand that this mine was inexhaustible, for Nature's<br>
creative power is far beyond man's instinct of destruction.  Ned Land,<br>
faithful to his instinct, hastened to fill a net which he carried by<br>
his side with some of the finest specimens.  But we could not stop.  We<br>
must follow the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known<br>
only to himself.  The ground was sensibly rising, and sometimes, on<br>
holding up my arm, it was above the surface of the sea.  Then the level<br>
of the bank would sink capriciously.  Often we rounded high rocks<br>
scarped into pyramids.  In their dark fractures huge crustacea, perched<br>
upon their high claws like some war-machine, watched us with fixed<br>
eyes, and under our feet crawled various kinds of annelides.<br>
<br>
At this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in a<br>
picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the<br>
submarine flora.  At first it seemed very dark to me.  The solar rays<br>
seemed to be extinguished by successive gradations, until its vague<br>
transparency became nothing more than drowned light.  Captain Nemo<br>
entered; we followed.  My eyes soon accustomed themselves to this<br>
relative state of darkness.  I could distinguish the arches springing<br>
capriciously from natural pillars, standing broad upon their granite<br>
base, like the heavy columns of Tuscan architecture.  Why had our<br>
incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?  I<br>
was soon to know.  After descending a rather sharp declivity, our feet<br>
trod the bottom of a kind of circular pit.  There Captain Nemo stopped,<br>
and with his hand indicated an object I had not yet perceived.  It was<br>
an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a gigantic tridacne, a goblet<br>
which could have contained a whole lake of holy-water, a basin the<br>
breadth of which was more than two yards and a half, and consequently<br>
larger than that ornamenting the saloon of the Nautilus.  I approached<br>
this extraordinary mollusc.  It adhered by its filaments to a table of<br>
granite, and there, isolated, it developed itself in the calm waters of<br>
the grotto.  I estimated the weight of this tridacne at 600 lb.  Such<br>
an oyster would contain 30 lb. of meat; and one must have the stomach<br>
of a Gargantua to demolish some dozens of them.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo was evidently acquainted with the existence of this<br>
bivalve, and seemed to have a particular motive in verifying the actual<br>
state of this tridacne.  The shells were a little open; the Captain<br>
came near and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing; then<br>
with his hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges, which<br>
formed a cloak for the creature.  There, between the folded plaits, I<br><a href="../site5/page5_7040.html">link5_text</a>
saw a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut. Its globular<br>
shape, perfect clearness, and admirable lustre made it altogether a<br>
jewel of inestimable value.  Carried away by my curiosity, I stretched<br>
out my hand to seize it, weigh it, and touch it; but the Captain<br>
stopped me, made a sign of refusal, and quickly withdrew his dagger,<br>
and the two shells closed suddenly.  I then understood Captain Nemo's<br>
intention.  In leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne<br>
he was allowing it to grow slowly.  Each year the secretions of the<br>
mollusc would add new concentric circles.  I estimated its value at<br>
L500,000 at least.<br>
<br>
After ten minutes Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  I thought he had<br>
halted previously to returning.  No; by a gesture he bade us crouch<br>
beside him in a deep fracture of the rock, his hand pointed to one part<br>
of the liquid mass, which I watched attentively.<br>
<br>
About five yards from me a shadow appeared, and sank to the ground.<br>
The disquieting idea of sharks shot through my mind, but I was<br>
mistaken; and once again it was not a monster of the ocean that we had<br>
anything to do with.<br>
<br>
It was a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I<br>
suppose, had come to glean before the harvest.  I could see the bottom<br>
of his canoe anchored some feet above his head.  He dived and went up<br>
successively.  A stone held between his feet, cut in the shape of a<br>
sugar loaf, whilst a rope fastened him to his boat, helped him to<br>
descend more rapidly.  This was all his apparatus.  Reaching the<br>
bottom, about five yards deep, he went on his knees and filled his bag<br>
with oysters picked up at random.  Then he went up, emptied it, pulled<br>
up his stone, and began the operation once more, which lasted thirty<br>
seconds.<br>
<br>
The diver did not see us.  The shadow of the rock hid us from sight.<br>
And how should this poor Indian ever dream that men, beings like<br>
himself, should be there under the water watching his movements and<br>
losing no detail of the fishing?  Several times he went up in this way,<br>
and dived again.  He did not carry away more than ten at each plunge,<br>
for he was obliged to pull them from the bank to which they adhered by<br>
means of their strong byssus.  And how many of those oysters for which<br>
he risked his life had no pearl in them!  I watched him closely; his<br>
manoeuvres were regular; and for the space of half an hour no danger<br>
appeared to threaten him.<br>
<br>
I was beginning to accustom myself to the sight of this interesting<br>
fishing, when suddenly, as the Indian was on the ground, I saw him make<br>
a gesture of terror, rise, and make a spring to return to the surface<br>
of the sea.<br>
<br>
I understood his dread.  A gigantic shadow appeared just above the<br>
unfortunate diver.  It was a shark of enormous size advancing<br>
diagonally, his eyes on fire, and his jaws open.  I was mute with<br>
horror and unable to move.<br>
<br>
The voracious creature shot towards the Indian, who threw himself on<br>
one side to avoid the shark's fins; but not its tail, for it struck his<br>
chest and stretched him on the ground.<br>
<br>
This scene lasted but a few seconds:  the shark returned, and, turning<br>
on his back, prepared himself for cutting the Indian in two, when I saw<br>
Captain Nemo rise suddenly, and then, dagger in hand, walk straight to<br>
the monster, ready to fight face to face with him.  The very moment the<br>
shark was going to snap the unhappy fisherman in two, he perceived his<br>
new adversary, and, turning over, made straight towards him.<br>
<br>
I can still see Captain Nemo's position.  Holding himself well<br>
together, he waited for the shark with admirable coolness; and, when it<br>
rushed at him, threw himself on one side with wonderful quickness,<br>
avoiding the shock, and burying his dagger deep into its side.  But it<br>
was not all over.  A terrible combat ensued.<br>
<br>
The shark had seemed to roar, if I might say so.  The blood rushed in<br>
torrents from its wound.  The sea was dyed red, and through the opaque<br>
liquid I could distinguish nothing more.  Nothing more until the moment<br>
when, like lightning, I saw the undaunted Captain hanging on to one of<br>
the creature's fins, struggling, as it were, hand to hand with the<br>
monster, and dealing successive blows at his enemy, yet still unable to<br>
give a decisive one.<br>
<br>
The shark's struggles agitated the water with such fury that the<br>
rocking threatened to upset me.<br>
<br>
I wanted to go to the Captain's assistance, but, nailed to the spot<br>
with horror, I could not stir.<br>
<br>
I saw the haggard eye; I saw the different phases of the fight.  The<br>
Captain fell to the earth, upset by the enormous mass which leant upon<br>
him.  The shark's jaws opened wide, like a pair of factory shears, and<br>
it would have been all over with the Captain; but, quick as thought,<br>
harpoon in hand, Ned Land rushed towards the shark and struck it with<br>
its sharp point.<br>
<br>
The waves were impregnated with a mass of blood.  They rocked under the<br>
shark's movements, which beat them with indescribable fury.  Ned Land<br>
had not missed his aim.  It was the monster's death-rattle.  Struck to<br>
the heart, it struggled in dreadful convulsions, the shock of which<br>
overthrew Conseil.<br>
<br>
But Ned Land had disentangled the Captain, who, getting up without any<br>
wound, went straight to the Indian, quickly cut the cord which held him<br>
to his stone, took him in his arms, and, with a sharp blow of his heel,<br>
mounted to the surface.<br>
<br>
We all three followed in a few seconds, saved by a miracle, and reached<br>
the fisherman's boat.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo's first care was to recall the unfortunate man to life<br>
again.  I did not think he could succeed.  I hoped so, for the poor<br>
creature's immersion was not long; but the blow from the shark's tail<br>
might have been his death-blow.<br>
<br>
Happily, with the Captain's and Conseil's sharp friction, I saw<br>
consciousness return by degrees.  He opened his eyes.  What was his<br>
surprise, his terror even, at seeing four great copper heads leaning<br>
over him!  And, above all, what must he have thought when Captain Nemo,<br>
drawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls, placed it in his<br>
hand!  This munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor<br>
Cingalese was accepted with a trembling hand.  His wondering eyes<br>
showed that he knew not to what super-human beings he owed both fortune<br>
and life.<br>
<br>
At a sign from the Captain we regained the bank, and, following the<br>
road already traversed, came in about half an hour to the anchor which<br>
held the canoe of the Nautilus to the earth.<br>
<br>
Once on board, we each, with the help of the sailors, got rid of the<br>
heavy copper helmet.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo's first word was to the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Thank you, Master Land," said he.<br>
<br>
"It was in revenge, Captain," replied Ned Land.  "I owed you that."<br>
<br>
A ghastly smile passed across the Captain's lips, and that was all.<br>
<br>
"To the Nautilus," said he.<br>
<br>
The boat flew over the waves.  Some minutes after we met the shark's<br>
dead body floating.  By the black marking of the extremity of its fins,<br>
I recognised the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the<br>
species of shark so properly called.  It was more than twenty-five feet<br>
long; its enormous mouth occupied one-third of its body.  It was an<br>
adult, as was known by its six rows of teeth placed in an isosceles<br>
triangle in the upper jaw.<br>
<br>
Whilst I was contemplating this inert mass, a dozen of these voracious<br>
beasts appeared round the boat; and, without noticing us, threw<br>
themselves upon the dead body and fought with one another for the<br><a href="../site9/page3_2815.html">link6_text</a>
pieces.<br>
<br>
At half-past eight we were again on board the Nautilus.  There I<br>
reflected on the incidents which had taken place in our excursion to<br>
the Manaar Bank.<br>
<br>
Two conclusions I must inevitably draw from it--one bearing upon the<br>
unparalleled courage of Captain Nemo, the other upon his devotion to a<br>
human being, a representative of that race from which he fled beneath<br>
the sea.  Whatever he might say, this strange man had not yet succeeded<br>
in entirely crushing his heart.<br>
<br>
When I made this observation to him, he answered in a slightly moved<br>
tone:<br>
<br>
"That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am<br>
still, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV<br>
<br>
THE RED SEA<br>
<br>
In the course of the day of the 29th of January, the island of Ceylon<br>
disappeared under the horizon, and the Nautilus, at a speed of twenty<br>
miles an hour, slid into the labyrinth of canals which separate the<br>
Maldives from the Laccadives.  It coasted even the Island of Kiltan, a<br>
land originally coraline, discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499, and one<br>
of the nineteen principal islands of the Laccadive Archipelago,<br>
situated between 10° and 14° 30' N. lat., and 69° 50' 72"<br>
E. long.<br>
<br>
We had made 16,220 miles, or 7,500 (French) leagues from our<br>
starting-point in the Japanese Seas.<br>
<br>
The next day (30th January), when the Nautilus went to the surface of<br>
the ocean there was no land in sight.  Its course was N.N.E., in the<br>
direction of the Sea of Oman, between Arabia and the Indian Peninsula,<br>
which serves as an outlet to the Persian Gulf.  It was evidently a<br>
block without any possible egress.  Where was Captain Nemo taking us<br>
to?  I could not say.  This, however, did not satisfy the Canadian, who<br>
that day came to me asking where we were going.<br>
<br>
"We are going where our Captain's fancy takes us, Master Ned."<br>
<br>
"His fancy cannot take us far, then," said the Canadian.  "The Persian<br>
Gulf has no outlet:  and, if we do go in, it will not be long before we<br>
are out again."<br>
<br>
"Very well, then, we will come out again, Master Land; and if, after<br>
the Persian Gulf, the Nautilus would like to visit the Red Sea, the<br>
Straits of Bab-el-mandeb are there to give us entrance."<br>
<br>
"I need not tell you, sir," said Ned Land, "that the Red Sea is as much<br>
closed as the Gulf, as the Isthmus of Suez is not yet cut; and, if it<br>
was, a boat as mysterious as ours would not risk itself in a canal cut<br>
with sluices.  And again, the Red Sea is not the road to take us back<br>
to Europe."<br>
<br>
"But I never said we were going back to Europe."<br>
<br>
"What do you suppose, then?"<br>
<br>
"I suppose that, after visiting the curious coasts of Arabia and Egypt,<br>
the Nautilus will go down the Indian Ocean again, perhaps cross the<br>
Channel of Mozambique, perhaps off the Mascarenhas, so as to gain the<br>
Cape of Good Hope."<br>
<br>
"And once at the Cape of Good Hope?" asked the Canadian, with peculiar<br>
emphasis.<br>
<br>
"Well, we shall penetrate into that Atlantic which we do not yet know.<br>
Ah! friend Ned, you are getting tired of this journey under the sea;<br>
you are surfeited with the incessantly varying spectacle of submarine<br>
wonders.  For my part, I shall be sorry to see the end of a voyage<br>
which it is given to so few men to make."<br>
<br>
For four days, till the 3rd of February, the Nautilus scoured the Sea<br>
of Oman, at various speeds and at various depths.  It seemed to go at<br>
random, as if hesitating as to which road it should follow, but we<br>
never passed the Tropic of Cancer.<br>
<br>
In quitting this sea we sighted Muscat for an instant, one of the most<br>
important towns of the country of Oman.  I admired its strange aspect,<br>
surrounded by black rocks upon which its white houses and forts stood<br>
in relief.  I saw the rounded domes of its mosques, the elegant points<br>
of its minarets, its fresh and verdant terraces.  But it was only a<br>
vision!  The Nautilus soon sank under the waves of that part of the sea.<br>
<br>
We passed along the Arabian coast of Mahrah and Hadramaut, for a<br>
distance of six miles, its undulating line of mountains being<br>
occasionally relieved by some ancient ruin.  The 5th of February we at<br>
last entered the Gulf of Aden, a perfect funnel introduced into the<br>
neck of Bab-el-mandeb, through which the Indian waters entered the Red<br>
Sea.<br>
<br>
The 6th of February, the Nautilus floated in sight of Aden, perched<br>
upon a promontory which a narrow isthmus joins to the mainland, a kind<br>
of inaccessible Gibraltar, the fortifications of which were rebuilt by<br>
the English after taking possession in 1839.  I caught a glimpse of the<br>
octagon minarets of this town, which was at one time the richest<br>
commercial magazine on the coast.<br>
<br>
I certainly thought that Captain Nemo, arrived at this point, would<br>
back out again; but I was mistaken, for he did no such thing, much to<br>
my surprise.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 7th of February, we entered the Straits of<br>
Bab-el-mandeb, the name of which, in the Arab tongue, means The Gate of<br>
Tears.<br>
<br>
To twenty miles in breadth, it is only thirty-two in length.  And for<br>
the Nautilus, starting at full speed, the crossing was scarcely the<br>
work of an hour.  But I saw nothing, not even the Island of Perim, with<br>
which the British Government has fortified the position of Aden.  There<br>
were too many English or French steamers of the line of Suez to Bombay,<br>
Calcutta to Melbourne, and from Bourbon to the Mauritius, furrowing<br>
this narrow passage, for the Nautilus to venture to show itself.  So it<br>
remained prudently below.  At last about noon, we were in the waters of<br>
the Red Sea.<br>
<br>
I would not even seek to understand the caprice which had decided<br>
Captain Nemo upon entering the gulf.  But I quite approved of the<br>
Nautilus entering it.  Its speed was lessened:  sometimes it kept on<br>
the surface, sometimes it dived to avoid a vessel, and thus I was able<br>
to observe the upper and lower parts of this curious sea.<br>
<br>
The 8th of February, from the first dawn of day, Mocha came in sight,<br>
now a ruined town, whose walls would fall at a gunshot, yet which<br>
shelters here and there some verdant date-trees; once an important<br>
city, containing six public markets, and twenty-six mosques, and whose<br>
walls, defended by fourteen forts, formed a girdle of two miles in<br>
circumference.<br>
<br>
The Nautilus then approached the African shore, where the depth of the<br>
sea was greater.  There, between two waters clear as crystal, through<br>
the open panels we were allowed to contemplate the beautiful bushes of<br>
brilliant coral and large blocks of rock clothed with a splendid fur of<br>
green variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and algae<br>
and fuci.  What an indescribable spectacle, and what variety of sites<br>
and landscapes along these sandbanks and volcanic islands which bound<br>
the Libyan coast!  But where these shrubs appeared in all their beauty<br>
was on the eastern coast, which the Nautilus soon gained.  It was on<br>
the coast of Tehama, for there not only did this display of zoophytes<br>
flourish beneath the level of the sea, but they also formed picturesque<br>
interlacings which unfolded themselves about sixty feet above the<br>
surface, more capricious but less highly coloured than those whose<br><a href="../site3/page5_1881.html">link7_text</a>
freshness was kept up by the vital power of the waters.<br>
<br>
What charming hours I passed thus at the window of the saloon!  What<br>
new specimens of submarine flora and fauna did I admire under the<br>
brightness of our electric lantern!<br>
<br>
The 9th of February the Nautilus floated in the broadest part of the<br>
Red Sea, which is comprised between Souakin, on the west coast, and<br>
Komfidah, on the east coast, with a diameter of ninety miles.<br>
<br>
That day at noon, after the bearings were taken, Captain Nemo mounted<br>
the platform, where I happened to be, and I was determined not to let<br>
him go down again without at least pressing him regarding his ulterior<br>
projects.  As soon as he saw me he approached and graciously offered me<br>
a cigar.<br>
<br>
"Well, sir, does this Red Sea please you?  Have you sufficiently<br>
observed the wonders it covers, its fishes, its zoophytes, its<br>
parterres of sponges, and its forests of coral?  Did you catch a<br>
glimpse of the towns on its borders?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, Captain Nemo," I replied; "and the Nautilus is wonderfully fitted<br>
for such a study.  Ah! it is an intelligent boat!"<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir, intelligent and invulnerable.  It fears neither the terrible<br>
tempests of the Red Sea, nor its currents, nor its sandbanks."<br>
<br>
"Certainly," said I, "this sea is quoted as one of the worst, and in<br>
the time of the ancients, if I am not mistaken, its reputation was<br>
detestable."<br>
<br>
"Detestable, M. Aronnax.  The Greek and Latin historians do not speak<br>
favourably of it, and Strabo says it is very dangerous during the<br>
Etesian winds and in the rainy season.  The Arabian Edrisi portrays it<br>
under the name of the Gulf of Colzoum, and relates that vessels<br>
perished there in great numbers on the sandbanks and that no one would<br>
risk sailing in the night.  It is, he pretends, a sea subject to<br>
fearful hurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands, and `which offers<br>
nothing good either on its surface or in its depths.'"<br>
<br>
"One may see," I replied, "that these historians never sailed on board<br>
the Nautilus."<br>
<br>
"Just so," replied the Captain, smiling; "and in that respect moderns<br>
are not more advanced than the ancients.  It required many ages to find<br>
out the mechanical power of steam.  Who knows if, in another hundred<br>
years, we may not see a second Nautilus?  Progress is slow, M. Aronnax."<br>
<br>
"It is true," I answered; "your boat is at least a century before its<br>
time, perhaps an era.  What a misfortune that the secret of such an<br>
invention should die with its inventor!"<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo did not reply.  After some minutes' silence he continued:<br>
<br>
"You were speaking of the opinions of ancient historians upon the<br>
dangerous navigation of the Red Sea."<br>
<br>
"It is true," said I; "but were not their fears exaggerated?"<br>
<br>
"Yes and no, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, who seemed to know the<br>
Red Sea by heart.  "That which is no longer dangerous for a modern<br>
vessel, well rigged, strongly built, and master of its own course,<br>
thanks to obedient steam, offered all sorts of perils to the ships of<br>
the ancients.  Picture to yourself those first navigators venturing in<br>
ships made of planks sewn with the cords of the palmtree, saturated<br>
with the grease of the seadog, and covered with powdered resin!  They<br>
had not even instruments wherewith to take their bearings, and they<br>
went by guess amongst currents of which they scarcely knew anything.<br>
Under such conditions shipwrecks were, and must have been, numerous.<br>
But in our time, steamers running between Suez and the South Seas have<br>
nothing more to fear from the fury of this gulf, in spite of contrary<br>
trade-winds. The captain and passengers do not prepare for their<br>
departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices; and, on their return,<br>
they no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the<br>
gods in the neighbouring temple."<br>
<br>
"I agree with you," said I; "and steam seems to have killed all<br>
gratitude in the hearts of sailors.  But, Captain, since you seem to<br>
have especially studied this sea, can you tell me the origin of its<br>
name?"<br>
<br>
"There exist several explanations on the subject, M. Aronnax.  Would<br>
you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?"<br>
<br>
"Willingly."<br>
<br>
"This fanciful writer pretends that its name was given to it after the<br>
passage of the Israelites, when Pharaoh perished in the waves which<br>
closed at the voice of Moses."<br>
<br>
"A poet's explanation, Captain Nemo," I replied; "but I cannot content<br>
myself with that.  I ask you for your personal opinion."<br>
<br>
"Here it is, M. Aronnax.  According to my idea, we must see in this<br>
appellation of the Red Sea a translation of the Hebrew word `Edom'; and<br>
if the ancients gave it that name, it was on account of the particular<br>
colour of its waters."<br>
<br>
"But up to this time I have seen nothing but transparent waves and<br>
without any particular colour."<br>
<br>
"Very likely; but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf, you will see<br>
this singular appearance.  I remember seeing the Bay of Tor entirely<br>
red, like a sea of blood."<br>
<br>
"And you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic<br>
seaweed?"<br>
<br>
"Yes."<br>
<br>
"So, Captain Nemo, it is not the first time you have overrun the Red<br>
Sea on board the Nautilus?"<br>
<br>
"No, sir."<br>
<br>
"As you spoke a while ago of the passage of the Israelites and of the<br>
catastrophe to the Egyptians, I will ask whether you have met with the<br>
traces under the water of this great historical fact?"<br>
<br>
"No, sir; and for a good reason."<br>
<br>
"What is it?"<br>
<br>
"It is that the spot where Moses and his people passed is now so<br>
blocked up with sand that the camels can barely bathe their legs there.<br>
You can well understand that there would not be water enough for my<br>
Nautilus."<br>
<br>
"And the spot?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"The spot is situated a little above the Isthmus of Suez, in the arm<br>
which formerly made a deep estuary, when the Red Sea extended to the<br>
Salt Lakes.  Now, whether this passage were miraculous or not, the<br>
Israelites, nevertheless, crossed there to reach the Promised Land, and<br>
Pharaoh's army perished precisely on that spot; and I think that<br>
excavations made in the middle of the sand would bring to light a large<br>
number of arms and instruments of Egyptian origin."<br>
<br>
"That is evident," I replied; "and for the sake of archaeologists let<br>
us hope that these excavations will be made sooner or later, when new<br>
towns are established on the isthmus, after the construction of the<br>
Suez Canal; a canal, however, very useless to a vessel like the<br>
Nautilus."<br>
<br>
"Very likely; but useful to the whole world," said Captain Nemo.  "The<br>
ancients well understood the utility of a communication between the Red<br>
Sea and the Mediterranean for their commercial affairs: but they did<br>
not think of digging a canal direct, and took the Nile as an<br><a href="../site7/page5_7470.html">link8_text</a>
intermediate.  Very probably the canal which united the Nile to the Red<br>
Sea was begun by Sesostris, if we may believe tradition.  One thing is<br>
certain, that in the year 615 before Jesus Christ, Necos undertook the<br>
works of an alimentary canal to the waters of the Nile across the plain<br>
of Egypt, looking towards Arabia.  It took four days to go up this<br>
canal, and it was so wide that two triremes could go abreast.  It was<br>
carried on by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, and probably finished by<br>
Ptolemy II.  Strabo saw it navigated:  but its decline from the point<br>
of departure, near Bubastes, to the Red Sea was so slight that it was<br>
only navigable for a few months in the year.  This canal answered all<br>
commercial purposes to the age of Antonius, when it was abandoned and<br>
blocked up with sand.  Restored by order of the Caliph Omar, it was<br>
definitely destroyed in 761 or 762 by Caliph Al-Mansor, who wished to<br>
prevent the arrival of provisions to Mohammed-ben-Abdallah, who had<br>
revolted against him.  During the expedition into Egypt, your General<br>
Bonaparte discovered traces of the works in the Desert of Suez; and,<br>
surprised by the tide, he nearly perished before regaining Hadjaroth,<br>
at the very place where Moses had encamped three thousand years before<br>
him."<br>
<br>
"Well, Captain, what the ancients dared not undertake, this junction<br>
between the two seas, which will shorten the road from Cadiz to India,<br>
M. Lesseps has succeeded in doing; and before long he will have changed<br>
Africa into an immense island."<br>
<br>
"Yes, M. Aronnax; you have the right to be proud of your countryman.<br>
Such a man brings more honour to a nation than great captains.  He<br>
began, like so many others, with disgust and rebuffs; but he has<br>
triumphed, for he has the genius of will.  And it is sad to think that<br>
a work like that, which ought to have been an international work and<br>
which would have sufficed to make a reign illustrious, should have<br>
succeeded by the energy of one man.  All honour to M. Lesseps!"<br>
<br>
"Yes! honour to the great citizen," I replied, surprised by the manner<br>
in which Captain Nemo had just spoken.<br>
<br>
"Unfortunately," he continued, "I cannot take you through the Suez<br>
Canal; but you will be able to see the long jetty of Port Said after<br>
to-morrow, when we shall be in the Mediterranean."<br>
<br>
"The Mediterranean!"  I exclaimed.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir; does that astonish you?"<br>
<br>
"What astonishes me is to think that we shall be there the day after<br>
to-morrow."<br>
<br>
"Indeed?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, Captain, although by this time I ought to have accustomed myself<br>
to be surprised at nothing since I have been on board your boat."<br>
<br>
"But the cause of this surprise?"<br>
<br>
"Well! it is the fearful speed you will have to put on the Nautilus, if<br>
the day after to-morrow she is to be in the Mediterranean, having made<br>
the round of Africa, and doubled the Cape of Good Hope!"<br>
<br>
"Who told you that she would make the round of Africa and double the<br>
Cape of Good Hope, sir?"<br>
<br>
"Well, unless the Nautilus sails on dry land, and passes above the<br>
isthmus----"<br>
<br>
"Or beneath it, M. Aronnax."<br>
<br>
"Beneath it?"<br>
<br>
"Certainly," replied Captain Nemo quietly.  "A long time ago Nature<br>
made under this tongue of land what man has this day made on its<br>
surface."<br>
<br>
"What! such a passage exists?"<br>
<br>
"Yes; a subterranean passage, which I have named the Arabian Tunnel.<br>
It takes us beneath Suez and opens into the Gulf of Pelusium."<br>
<br>
"But this isthmus is composed of nothing but quick sands?"<br>
<br>
"To a certain depth.  But at fifty-five yards only there is a solid<br>
layer of rock."<br>
<br>
"Did you discover this passage by chance?"  I asked more and more<br>
surprised.<br>
<br>
"Chance and reasoning, sir; and by reasoning even more than by chance.<br>
Not only does this passage exist, but I have profited by it several<br>
times.  Without that I should not have ventured this day into the<br>
impassable Red Sea.  I noticed that in the Red Sea and in the<br>
Mediterranean there existed a certain number of fishes of a kind<br>
perfectly identical.  Certain of the fact, I asked myself was it<br>
possible that there was no communication between the two seas?  If<br>
there was, the subterranean current must necessarily run from the Red<br>
Sea to the Mediterranean, from the sole cause of difference of level.<br>
I caught a large number of fishes in the neighbourhood of Suez.  I<br>
passed a copper ring through their tails, and threw them back into the<br>
sea.  Some months later, on the coast of Syria, I caught some of my<br>
fish ornamented with the ring.  Thus the communication between the two<br>
was proved.  I then sought for it with my Nautilus; I discovered it,<br>
ventured into it, and before long, sir, you too will have passed<br>
through my Arabian tunnel!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V<br>
<br>
THE ARABIAN TUNNEL<br>
<br>
That same evening, in 21° 30' N. lat., the Nautilus floated on the<br>
surface of the sea, approaching the Arabian coast.  I saw Djeddah, the<br>
most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India.  I<br>
distinguished clearly enough its buildings, the vessels anchored at the<br>
quays, and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the<br>
roads.  The sun, rather low on the horizon, struck full on the houses<br>
of the town, bringing out their whiteness.  Outside, some wooden<br>
cabins, and some made of reeds, showed the quarter inhabited by the<br>
Bedouins.  Soon Djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night,<br>
and the Nautilus found herself under water slightly phosphorescent.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 10th of February, we sighted several ships running to<br>
windward.  The Nautilus returned to its submarine navigation; but at<br>
noon, when her bearings were taken, the sea being deserted, she rose<br>
again to her waterline.<br>
<br>
Accompanied by Ned and Conseil, I seated myself on the platform.  The<br>
coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a<br>
damp fog.<br>
<br>
We were leaning on the sides of the pinnace, talking of one thing and<br>
another, when Ned Land, stretching out his hand towards a spot on the<br>
sea, said:<br>
<br>
"Do you see anything there, sir?"<br>
<br>
"No, Ned," I replied; "but I have not your eyes, you know."<br>
<br>
"Look well," said Ned, "there, on the starboard beam, about the height<br>
of the lantern!  Do you not see a mass which seems to move?"<br>
<br>
"Certainly," said I, after close attention; "I see something like a<br>
long black body on the top of the water."<br>
<br>
And certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile<br>
from us.  It looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea.<br>
It was a gigantic dugong!<br>
<br>
Ned Land looked eagerly.  His eyes shone with covetousness at the sight<br>
of the animal.  His hand seemed ready to harpoon it.  One would have<br><a href="../site3/page4_8806.html">link9_text</a>
thought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and<br>
attack it in its element.<br>
<br>
At this instant Captain Nemo appeared on the platform.  He saw the<br>
dugong, understood the Canadian's attitude, and, addressing him, said:<br>
<br>
"If you held a harpoon just now, Master Land, would it not burn your<br>
hand?"<br>
<br>
"Just so, sir."<br>
<br>
"And you would not be sorry to go back, for one day, to your trade of a<br>
fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have<br>
already killed?"<br>
<br>
"I should not, sir."<br>
<br>
"Well, you can try."<br>
<br>
"Thank you, sir," said Ned Land, his eyes flaming.<br>
<br>
"Only," continued the Captain, "I advise you for your own sake not to<br>
miss the creature."<br>
<br>
"Is the dugong dangerous to attack?"  I asked, in spite of the<br>
Canadian's shrug of the shoulders.<br>
<br>
"Yes," replied the Captain; "sometimes the animal turns upon its<br>
assailants and overturns their boat.  But for Master Land this danger<br>
is not to be feared.  His eye is prompt, his arm sure."<br>
<br>
At this moment seven men of the crew, mute and immovable as ever,<br>
mounted the platform.  One carried a harpoon and a line similar to<br>
those employed in catching whales.  The pinnace was lifted from the<br>
bridge, pulled from its socket, and let down into the sea.  Six oarsmen<br>
took their seats, and the coxswain went to the tiller.  Ned, Conseil,<br>
and I went to the back of the boat.<br>
<br>
"You are not coming, Captain?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"No, sir; but I wish you good sport."<br>
<br>
The boat put off, and, lifted by the six rowers, drew rapidly towards<br>
the dugong, which floated about two miles from the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
Arrived some cables-length from the cetacean, the speed slackened, and<br>
the oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters.  Ned Land, harpoon<br>
in hand, stood in the fore part of the boat.  The harpoon used for<br>
striking the whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs<br>
out rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him.  But here the<br>
cord was not more than ten fathoms long, and the extremity was attached<br>
to a small barrel which, by floating, was to show the course the dugong<br>
took under the water.<br>
<br>
I stood and carefully watched the Canadian's adversary.  This dugong,<br>
which also bears the name of the halicore, closely resembles the<br>
manatee; its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail, and its<br>
lateral fins in perfect fingers.  Its difference from the manatee<br>
consisted in its upper jaw, which was armed with two long and pointed<br>
teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks.<br>
<br>
This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal<br>
dimensions; it was more than seven yards long.  It did not move, and<br>
seemed to be sleeping on the waves, which circumstance made it easier<br>
to capture.<br>
<br>
The boat approached within six yards of the animal.  The oars rested on<br>
the rowlocks.  I half rose.  Ned Land, his body thrown a little back,<br>
brandished the harpoon in his experienced hand.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a hissing noise was heard, and the dugong disappeared.  The<br>
harpoon, although thrown with great force; had apparently only struck<br>
the water.<br>
<br>
"Curse it!" exclaimed the Canadian furiously; "I have missed it!"<br>
<br>
"No," said I; "the creature is wounded--look at the blood; but your<br>
weapon has not stuck in his body."<br>
<br>
"My harpoon! my harpoon!" cried Ned Land.<br>
<br>
The sailors rowed on, and the coxswain made for the floating barrel.<br>
The harpoon regained, we followed in pursuit of the animal.<br>
<br>
The latter came now and then to the surface to breathe.  Its wound had<br>
not weakened it, for it shot onwards with great rapidity.<br>
<br>
The boat, rowed by strong arms, flew on its track.  Several times it<br>
approached within some few yards, and the Canadian was ready to strike,<br>
but the dugong made off with a sudden plunge, and it was impossible to<br>
reach it.<br>
<br>
Imagine the passion which excited impatient Ned Land!  He hurled at the<br>
unfortunate creature the most energetic expletives in the English<br>
tongue.  For my part, I was only vexed to see the dugong escape all our<br>
attacks.<br>
<br>
We pursued it without relaxation for an hour, and I began to think it<br>
would prove difficult to capture, when the animal, possessed with the<br>
perverse idea of vengeance of which he had cause to repent, turned upon<br>
the pinnace and assailed us in its turn.<br>
<br>
This manoeuvre did not escape the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Look out!" he cried.<br>
<br>
The coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue, doubtless<br>
warning the men to keep on their guard.<br>
<br>
The dugong came within twenty feet of the boat, stopped, sniffed the<br>
air briskly with its large nostrils (not pierced at the extremity, but<br>
in the upper part of its muzzle). Then, taking a spring, he threw<br>
himself upon us.<br>
<br>
The pinnace could not avoid the shock, and half upset, shipped at least<br>
two tons of water, which had to be emptied; but, thanks to the<br>
coxswain, we caught it sideways, not full front, so we were not quite<br>
overturned.  While Ned Land, clinging to the bows, belaboured the<br>
gigantic animal with blows from his harpoon, the creature's teeth were<br>
buried in the gunwale, and it lifted the whole thing out of the water,<br>
as a lion does a roebuck.  We were upset over one another, and I know<br>
not how the adventure would have ended, if the Canadian, still enraged<br>
with the beast, had not struck it to the heart.<br>
<br>
I heard its teeth grind on the iron plate, and the dugong disappeared,<br>
carrying the harpoon with him.  But the barrel soon returned to the<br>
surface, and shortly after the body of the animal, turned on its back.<br>
The boat came up with it, took it in tow, and made straight for the<br>
Nautilus.<br>
<br>
It required tackle of enormous strength to hoist the dugong on to the<br>
platform.  It weighed 10,000 lb.<br>
<br>
The next day, 11th February, the larder of the Nautilus was enriched by<br>
some more delicate game.  A flight of sea-swallows rested on the<br>
