<br>
"No."<br>
<br>
"The Nautilus has stranded?"<br>
<br>
"Yes."<br>
<br>
"And this has happened--how?"<br>
<br>
"From a caprice of nature, not from the ignorance of man.  Not a<br>
mistake has been made in the working.  But we cannot prevent<br>
equilibrium from producing its effects.  We may brave human laws, but<br>
we cannot resist natural ones."<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo had chosen a strange moment for uttering this<br>
philosophical reflection.  On the whole, his answer helped me little.<br>
<br>
"May I ask, sir, the cause of this accident?"<br>
<br>
"An enormous block of ice, a whole mountain, has turned over," he<br>
replied.  "When icebergs are undermined at their base by warmer water<br>
or reiterated shocks their centre of gravity rises, and the whole thing<br>
turns over.  This is what has happened; one of these blocks, as it<br>
fell, struck the Nautilus, then, gliding under its hull, raised it with<br>
irresistible force, bringing it into beds which are not so thick, where<br>
it is lying on its side."<br>
<br>
"But can we not get the Nautilus off by emptying its reservoirs, that<br>
it might regain its equilibrium?"<br>
<br>
"That, sir, is being done at this moment.  You can hear the pump<br>
working.  Look at the needle of the manometer; it shows that the<br>
Nautilus is rising, but the block of ice is floating with it; and,<br>
until some obstacle stops its ascending motion, our position cannot be<br>
altered."<br>
<br>
Indeed, the Nautilus still held the same position to starboard;<br>
doubtless it would right itself when the block stopped.  But at this<br>
moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two<br>
glassy surfaces?  I reflected on all the consequences of our position.<br>
Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the manometer.  Since the fall of<br>
the iceberg, the Nautilus had risen about a hundred and fifty feet, but<br>
it still made the same angle with the perpendicular.  Suddenly a slight<br>
movement was felt in the hold.  Evidently it was righting a little.<br>
Things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their normal<br>
position.  The partitions were nearing the upright.  No one spoke.<br>
With beating hearts we watched and felt the straightening.  The boards<br>
became horizontal under our feet.  Ten minutes passed.<br>
<br>
"At last we have righted!"  I exclaimed.<br>
<br>
"Yes," said Captain Nemo, going to the door of the saloon.<br>
<br>
"But are we floating?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Certainly," he replied; "since the reservoirs are not empty; and, when<br>
empty, the Nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea."<br>
<br>
We were in open sea; but at a distance of about ten yards, on either<br>
side of the Nautilus, rose a dazzling wall of ice.  Above and beneath<br>
the same wall.  Above, because the lower surface of the iceberg<br>
stretched over us like an immense ceiling.  Beneath, because the<br>
overturned block, having slid by degrees, had found a resting-place on<br>
the lateral walls, which kept it in that position.  The Nautilus was<br>
really imprisoned in a perfect tunnel of ice more than twenty yards in<br>
breadth, filled with quiet water.  It was easy to get out of it by<br>
going either forward or backward, and then make a free passage under<br>
the iceberg, some hundreds of yards deeper.  The luminous ceiling had<br>
been extinguished, but the saloon was still resplendent with intense<br>
light.  It was the powerful reflection from the glass partition sent<br>
violently back to the sheets of the lantern.  I cannot describe the<br>
effect of the voltaic rays upon the great blocks so capriciously cut;<br>
upon every angle, every ridge, every facet was thrown a different<br>
light, according to the nature of the veins running through the ice; a<br>
dazzling mine of gems, particularly of sapphires, their blue rays<br>
crossing with the green of the emerald.  Here and there were opal<br>
shades of wonderful softness, running through bright spots like<br>
diamonds of fire, the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear.  The<br>
power of the lantern seemed increased a hundredfold, like a lamp<br>
through the lenticular plates of a first-class lighthouse.<br>
<br>
"How beautiful! how beautiful!" cried Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Yes," I said, "it is a wonderful sight.  Is it not, Ned?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, confound it!  Yes," answered Ned Land, "it is superb!  I am mad<br>
at being obliged to admit it.  No one has ever seen anything like it;<br>
but the sight may cost us dear.  And, if I must say all, I think we are<br>
seeing here things which God never intended man to see."<br>
<br>
Ned was right, it was too beautiful.  Suddenly a cry from Conseil made<br>
me turn.<br>
<br>
"What is it?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Shut your eyes, sir!  Do not look, sir!"  Saying which, Conseil<br>
clapped his hands over his eyes.<br>
<br>
"But what is the matter, my boy?"<br>
<br>
"I am dazzled, blinded."<br><a href="../site4/page7_1049.html">link1_text</a>
<br>
My eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass, but I could not stand<br>
the fire which seemed to devour them.  I understood what had happened.<br>
The Nautilus had put on full speed.  All the quiet lustre of the<br>
ice-walls was at once changed into flashes of lightning.  The fire from<br>
these myriads of diamonds was blinding.  It required some time to calm<br>
our troubled looks.  At last the hands were taken down.<br>
<br>
"Faith, I should never have believed it," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
It was then five in the morning; and at that moment a shock was felt at<br>
the bows of the Nautilus.  I knew that its spur had struck a block of<br>
ice.  It must have been a false manoeuvre, for this submarine tunnel,<br>
obstructed by blocks, was not very easy navigation.  I thought that<br>
Captain Nemo, by changing his course, would either turn these obstacles<br>
or else follow the windings of the tunnel.  In any case, the road<br>
before us could not be entirely blocked.  But, contrary to my<br>
expectations, the Nautilus took a decided retrograde motion.<br>
<br>
"We are going backwards?" said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Yes," I replied.  "This end of the tunnel can have no egress."<br>
<br>
"And then?"<br>
<br>
"Then," said I, "the working is easy.  We must go back again, and go<br>
out at the southern opening.  That is all."<br>
<br>
In speaking thus, I wished to appear more confident than I really was.<br>
But the retrograde motion of the Nautilus was increasing; and,<br>
reversing the screw, it carried us at great speed.<br>
<br>
"It will be a hindrance," said Ned.<br>
<br>
"What does it matter, some hours more or less, provided we get out at<br>
last?"<br>
<br>
"Yes," repeated Ned Land, "provided we do get out at last!"<br>
<br>
For a short time I walked from the saloon to the library.  My<br>
companions were silent.  I soon threw myself on an ottoman, and took a<br>
book, which my eyes overran mechanically.  A quarter of an hour after,<br>
Conseil, approaching me, said, "Is what you are reading very<br>
interesting, sir?"<br>
<br>
"Very interesting!"  I replied.<br>
<br>
"I should think so, sir.  It is your own book you are reading."<br>
<br>
"My book?"<br>
<br>
And indeed I was holding in my hand the work on the Great Submarine<br>
Depths.  I did not even dream of it.  I closed the book and returned to<br>
my walk.  Ned and Conseil rose to go.<br>
<br>
"Stay here, my friends," said I, detaining them.  "Let us remain<br>
together until we are out of this block."<br>
<br>
"As you please, sir," Conseil replied.<br>
<br>
Some hours passed.  I often looked at the instruments hanging from the<br>
partition.  The manometer showed that the Nautilus kept at a constant<br>
depth of more than three hundred yards; the compass still pointed to<br>
south; the log indicated a speed of twenty miles an hour, which, in<br>
such a cramped space, was very great.  But Captain Nemo knew that he<br>
could not hasten too much, and that minutes were worth ages to us.  At<br>
twenty-five minutes past eight a second shock took place, this time<br>
from behind.  I turned pale.  My companions were close by my side.  I<br>
seized Conseil's hand.  Our looks expressed our feelings better than<br>
words.  At this moment the Captain entered the saloon.  I went up to<br>
him.<br>
<br>
"Our course is barred southward?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir.  The iceberg has shifted and closed every outlet."<br>
<br>
"We are blocked up then?"<br>
<br>
"Yes."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVI<br>
<br>
WANT OF AIR<br>
<br>
Thus around the Nautilus, above and below, was an impenetrable wall of<br>
ice.  We were prisoners to the iceberg.  I watched the Captain.  His<br>
countenance had resumed its habitual imperturbability.<br>
<br>
"Gentlemen," he said calmly, "there are two ways of dying in the<br>
circumstances in which we are placed."  (This puzzling person had the<br>
air of a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupils.) "The first is<br>
to be crushed; the second is to die of suffocation.  I do not speak of<br>
the possibility of dying of hunger, for the supply of provisions in the<br>
Nautilus will certainly last longer than we shall.  Let us, then,<br>
calculate our chances."<br>
<br>
"As to suffocation, Captain," I replied, "that is not to be feared,<br>
because our reservoirs are full."<br><a href="../site7/page8_6796.html">link2_text</a>
<br>
"Just so; but they will only yield two days' supply of air.  Now, for<br>
thirty-six hours we have been hidden under the water, and already the<br>
heavy atmosphere of the Nautilus requires renewal.  In forty-eight<br>
hours our reserve will be exhausted."<br>
<br>
"Well, Captain, can we be delivered before forty-eight hours?"<br>
<br>
"We will attempt it, at least, by piercing the wall that surrounds us."<br>
<br>
"On which side?"<br>
<br>
"Sound will tell us.  I am going to run the Nautilus aground on the<br>
lower bank, and my men will attack the iceberg on the side that is<br>
least thick."<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo went out.  Soon I discovered by a hissing noise that the<br>
water was entering the reservoirs.  The Nautilus sank slowly, and<br>
rested on the ice at a depth of 350 yards, the depth at which the lower<br>
bank was immersed.<br>
<br>
"My friends," I said, "our situation is serious, but I rely on your<br>
courage and energy."<br>
<br>
"Sir," replied the Canadian, "I am ready to do anything for the general<br>
safety."<br>
<br>
"Good!  Ned," and I held out my hand to the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"I will add," he continued, "that, being as handy with the pickaxe as<br>
with the harpoon, if I can be useful to the Captain, he can command my<br>
services."<br>
<br>
"He will not refuse your help.  Come, Ned!"<br>
<br>
I led him to the room where the crew of the Nautilus were putting on<br>
their cork-jackets. I told the Captain of Ned's proposal, which he<br>
accepted.  The Canadian put on his sea-costume, and was ready as soon<br>
as his companions.  When Ned was dressed, I re-entered the<br>
drawing-room, where the panes of glass were open, and, posted near<br>
Conseil, I examined the ambient beds that supported the Nautilus.  Some<br>
instants after, we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank of ice,<br>
and among them Ned Land, easily known by his stature.  Captain Nemo was<br>
with them.  Before proceeding to dig the walls, he took the soundings,<br>
to be sure of working in the right direction.  Long sounding lines were<br>
sunk in the side walls, but after fifteen yards they were again stopped<br>
by the thick wall.  It was useless to attack it on the ceiling-like<br>
surface, since the iceberg itself measured more than 400 yards in<br>
height.  Captain Nemo then sounded the lower surface.  There ten yards<br>
of wall separated us from the water, so great was the thickness of the<br>
ice-field. It was necessary, therefore, to cut from it a piece equal in<br>
extent to the waterline of the Nautilus.  There were about 6,000 cubic<br>
yards to detach, so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the<br>
ice-field. The work had begun immediately and carried on with<br>
indefatigable energy.  Instead of digging round the Nautilus which<br>
would have involved greater difficulty, Captain Nemo had an immense<br>
trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter. Then the men set to<br>
work simultaneously with their screws on several points of its<br>
circumference.  Presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matter<br>
vigorously, and large blocks were detached from the mass.  By a curious<br>
effect of specific gravity, these blocks, lighter than water, fled, so<br>
to speak, to the vault of the tunnel, that increased in thickness at<br>
the top in proportion as it diminished at the base.  But that mattered<br>
little, so long as the lower part grew thinner.  After two hours' hard<br>
work, Ned Land came in exhausted.  He and his comrades were replaced by<br>
new workers, whom Conseil and I joined.  The second lieutenant of the<br>
Nautilus superintended us.  The water seemed singularly cold, but I<br>
soon got warm handling the pickaxe.  My movements were free enough,<br>
although they were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres.  When I<br>
re-entered, after working two hours, to take some food and rest, I<br>
found a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the<br>
Rouquayrol engine supplied me and the atmosphere of the Nautilus,<br>
already charged with carbonic acid.  The air had not been renewed for<br>
forty-eight hours, and its vivifying qualities were considerably<br>
enfeebled.  However, after a lapse of twelve hours, we had only raised<br>
a block of ice one yard thick, on the marked surface, which was about<br>
600 cubic yards!  Reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish<br>
this much it would take five nights and four days to bring this<br>
enterprise to a satisfactory conclusion.  Five nights and four days!<br>
And we have only air enough for two days in the reservoirs!  "Without<br>
taking into account," said Ned, "that, even if we get out of this<br>
infernal prison, we shall also be imprisoned under the iceberg, shut<br>
out from all possible communication with the atmosphere." True enough!<br>
Who could then foresee the minimum of time necessary for our<br>
deliverance?  We might be suffocated before the Nautilus could regain<br>
the surface of the waves?  Was it destined to perish in this ice-tomb,<br>
with all those it enclosed?  The situation was terrible.  But everyone<br>
had looked the danger in the face, and each was determined to do his<br>
duty to the last.<br>
<br>
As I expected, during the night a new block a yard square was carried<br>
away, and still further sank the immense hollow.  But in the morning<br>
when, dressed in my cork-jacket, I traversed the slushy mass at a<br>
temperature of six or seven degrees below zero, I remarked that the<br>
side walls were gradually closing in.  The beds of water farthest from<br>
the trench, that were not warmed by the men's work, showed a tendency<br>
to solidification.  In presence of this new and imminent danger, what<br>
would become of our chances of safety, and how hinder the<br>
solidification of this liquid medium, that would burst the partitions<br>
of the Nautilus like glass?<br><a href="../site1/page5_5272.html">link3_text</a>
<br>
I did not tell my companions of this new danger.  What was the good of<br>
damping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape?  But<br>
when I went on board again, I told Captain Nemo of this grave<br>
complication.<br>
<br>
"I know it," he said, in that calm tone which could counteract the most<br>
terrible apprehensions.  "It is one danger more; but I see no way of<br>
escaping it; the only chance of safety is to go quicker than<br>
solidification.  We must be beforehand with it, that is all."<br>
<br>
On this day for several hours I used my pickaxe vigorously.  The work<br>
kept me up.  Besides, to work was to quit the Nautilus, and breathe<br>
directly the pure air drawn from the reservoirs, and supplied by our<br>
apparatus, and to quit the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere.<br>
Towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper.  When I returned on<br>
board, I was nearly suffocated by the carbonic acid with which the air<br>
was filled--ah! if we had only the chemical means to drive away this<br>
deleterious gas.  We had plenty of oxygen; all this water contained a<br>
considerable quantity, and by dissolving it with our powerful piles, it<br>
would restore the vivifying fluid.  I had thought well over it; but of<br>
what good was that, since the carbonic acid produced by our respiration<br>
had invaded every part of the vessel?  To absorb it, it was necessary<br>
to fill some jars with caustic potash, and to shake them incessantly.<br>
Now this substance was wanting on board, and nothing could replace it.<br>
On that evening, Captain Nemo ought to open the taps of his reservoirs,<br>
and let some pure air into the interior of the Nautilus; without this<br>
precaution we could not get rid of the sense of suffocation.  The next<br>
day, March 26th, I resumed my miner's work in beginning the fifth yard.<br>
The side walls and the lower surface of the iceberg thickened visibly.<br>
It was evident that they would meet before the Nautilus was able to<br>
disengage itself.  Despair seized me for an instant; my pickaxe nearly<br>
fell from my hands.  What was the good of digging if I must be<br>
suffocated, crushed by the water that was turning into stone?--a<br>
punishment that the ferocity of the savages even would not have<br>
invented!  Just then Captain Nemo passed near me.  I touched his hand<br>
and showed him the walls of our prison.  The wall to port had advanced<br>
to at least four yards from the hull of the Nautilus.  The Captain<br>
understood me, and signed me to follow him.  We went on board.  I took<br>
off my cork-jacket and accompanied him into the drawing-room.<br>
<br>
"M. Aronnax, we must attempt some desperate means, or we shall be<br>
sealed up in this solidified water as in cement."<br>
<br>
"Yes; but what is to be done?"<br>
<br>
"Ah! if my Nautilus were strong enough to bear this pressure without<br>
being crushed!"<br>
<br>
"Well?"  I asked, not catching the Captain's idea.<br>
<br>
"Do you not understand," he replied, "that this congelation of water<br>
will help us?  Do you not see that by its solidification, it would<br>
burst through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes,<br>
it bursts the hardest stones?  Do you not perceive that it would be an<br>
agent of safety instead of destruction?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, Captain, perhaps.  But, whatever resistance to crushing the<br>
Nautilus possesses, it could not support this terrible pressure, and<br>
would be flattened like an iron plate."<br>
<br>
"I know it, sir.  Therefore we must not reckon on the aid of nature,<br>
but on our own exertions.  We must stop this solidification.  Not only<br>
will the side walls be pressed together; but there is not ten feet of<br>
water before or behind the Nautilus.  The congelation gains on us on<br>
all sides."<br>
<br>
"How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on<br>
board?"<br>
<br>
The Captain looked in my face.  "After to-morrow they will be empty!"<br>
<br>
A cold sweat came over me.  However, ought I to have been astonished at<br>
the answer?  On March 22, the Nautilus was in the open polar seas.  We<br>
were at 26°. For five days we had lived on the reserve on board.<br>
And what was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers.<br>
Even now, as I write, my recollection is still so vivid that an<br>
involuntary terror seizes me and my lungs seem to be without air.<br>
Meanwhile, Captain Nemo reflected silently, and evidently an idea had<br>
struck him; but he seemed to reject it.  At last, these words escaped<br>
his lips:<br>
<br>
"Boiling water!" he muttered.<br>
<br>
"Boiling water?"  I cried.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir.  We are enclosed in a space that is relatively confined.<br>
Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps,<br>
raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?"<br>
<br>
"Let us try it," I said resolutely.<br>
<br>
"Let us try it, Professor."<br>
<br>
The thermometer then stood at 7° outside.  Captain Nemo took me to<br>
the galleys, where the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished<br>
the drinkable water by evaporation.  They filled these with water, and<br>
all the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms<br>
bathed in the liquid.  In a few minutes this water reached 100°. It<br>
was directed towards the pumps, while fresh water replaced it in<br><a href="../site5/page8_6348.html">link4_text</a>
proportion.  The heat developed by the troughs was such that cold<br>
water, drawn up from the sea after only having gone through the<br>
machines, came boiling into the body of the pump.  The injection was<br>
begun, and three hours after the thermometer marked 6° below zero<br>
outside.  One degree was gained.  Two hours later the thermometer only<br>
marked 4°.<br>
<br>
"We shall succeed," I said to the Captain, after having anxiously<br>
watched the result of the operation.<br>
<br>
"I think," he answered, "that we shall not be crushed.  We have no more<br>
suffocation to fear."<br>
<br>
During the night the temperature of the water rose to 1° below<br>
zero.  The injections could not carry it to a higher point.  But, as<br>
the congelation of the sea-water produces at least 2°, I was at<br>
least reassured against the dangers of solidification.<br>
<br>
The next day, March 27th, six yards of ice had been cleared, twelve<br>
feet only remaining to be cleared away.  There was yet forty-eight<br>
hours' work.  The air could not be renewed in the interior of the<br>
Nautilus.  And this day would make it worse.  An intolerable weight<br>
oppressed me.  Towards three o'clock in the evening this feeling rose<br>
to a violent degree.  Yawns dislocated my jaws.  My lungs panted as<br>
they inhaled this burning fluid, which became rarefied more and more.<br>
A moral torpor took hold of me.  I was powerless, almost unconscious.<br>
My brave Conseil, though exhibiting the same symptoms and suffering in<br>
the same manner, never left me.  He took my hand and encouraged me, and<br>
I heard him murmur, "Oh! if I could only not breathe, so as to leave<br>
more air for my master!"<br>
<br>
Tears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus.  If our situation to<br>
all was intolerable in the interior, with what haste and gladness would<br>
we put on our cork-jackets to work in our turn!  Pickaxes sounded on<br>
the frozen ice-beds. Our arms ached, the skin was torn off our hands.<br>
But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?  Vital air<br>
came to the lungs!  We breathed! we breathed!<br>
<br>
All this time no one prolonged his voluntary task beyond the prescribed<br>
time.  His task accomplished, each one handed in turn to his panting<br>
companions the apparatus that supplied him with life.  Captain Nemo set<br>
the example, and submitted first to this severe discipline.  When the<br>
time came, he gave up his apparatus to another and returned to the<br>
vitiated air on board, calm, unflinching, unmurmuring.<br>
<br>
On that day the ordinary work was accomplished with unusual vigour.<br>
Only two yards remained to be raised from the surface.  Two yards only<br>
separated us from the open sea.  But the reservoirs were nearly emptied<br>
of air.  The little that remained ought to be kept for the workers; not<br>
a particle for the Nautilus.  When I went back on board, I was half<br>
suffocated.  What a night!  I know not how to describe it.  The next<br>
day my breathing was oppressed.  Dizziness accompanied the pain in my<br>
head and made me like a drunken man.  My companions showed the same<br>
symptoms.  Some of the crew had rattling in the throat.<br>
<br>
On that day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo, finding the<br>
pickaxes work too slowly, resolved to crush the ice-bed that still<br>
separated us from the liquid sheet.  This man's coolness and energy<br>
never forsook him.  He subdued his physical pains by moral force.<br>
<br>
By his orders the vessel was lightened, that is to say, raised from the<br>
ice-bed by a change of specific gravity.  When it floated they towed it<br>
so as to bring it above the immense trench made on the level of the<br>
water-line. Then, filling his reservoirs of water, he descended and<br>
shut himself up in the hole.<br>
<br>
Just then all the crew came on board, and the double door of<br>
communication was shut.  The Nautilus then rested on the bed of ice,<br>
which was not one yard thick, and which the sounding leads had<br>
perforated in a thousand places.  The taps of the reservoirs were then<br>
opened, and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in, increasing the<br>
weight of the Nautilus to 1,800 tons.  We waited, we listened,<br>
forgetting our sufferings in hope.  Our safety depended on this last<br>
chance.  Notwithstanding the buzzing in my head, I soon heard the<br>
humming sound under the hull of the Nautilus.  The ice cracked with a<br>
singular noise, like tearing paper, and the Nautilus sank.<br>
<br>
"We are off!" murmured Conseil in my ear.<br>
<br>
I could not answer him.  I seized his hand, and pressed it<br>
convulsively.  All at once, carried away by its frightful overcharge,<br>
the Nautilus sank like a bullet under the waters, that is to say, it<br>
fell as if it was in a vacuum.  Then all the electric force was put on<br>
the pumps, that soon began to let the water out of the reservoirs.<br>
After some minutes, our fall was stopped.  Soon, too, the manometer<br>
indicated an ascending movement.  The screw, going at full speed, made<br>
the iron hull tremble to its very bolts and drew us towards the north.<br>
But if this floating under the iceberg is to last another day before we<br>
reach the open sea, I shall be dead first.<br>
<br>
Half stretched upon a divan in the library, I was suffocating.  My face<br>
was purple, my lips blue, my faculties suspended.  I neither saw nor<br>
heard.  All notion of time had gone from my mind.  My muscles could not<br>
contract.  I do not know how many hours passed thus, but I was<br>
conscious of the agony that was coming over me.  I felt as if I was<br>
going to die.  Suddenly I came to.  Some breaths of air penetrated my<br>
lungs.  Had we risen to the surface of the waves?  Were we free of the<br>
iceberg?  No!  Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends, were sacrificing<br>
themselves to save me.  Some particles of air still remained at the<br>
bottom of one apparatus.  Instead of using it, they had kept it for me,<br><a href="../site4/page5_7543.html">link5_text</a>
and, while they were being suffocated, they gave me life, drop by drop.<br>
I wanted to push back the thing; they held my hands, and for some<br>
moments I breathed freely.  I looked at the clock; it was eleven in the<br>
morning.  It ought to be the 28th of March.  The Nautilus went at a<br>
frightful pace, forty miles an hour.  It literally tore through the<br>
water.  Where was Captain Nemo?  Had he succumbed?  Were his companions<br>
dead with him?  At the moment the manometer indicated that we were not<br>
more than twenty feet from the surface.  A mere plate of ice separated<br>
us from the atmosphere.  Could we not break it?  Perhaps.  In any case<br>
the Nautilus was going to attempt it.  I felt that it was in an oblique<br>
position, lowering the stern, and raising the bows.  The introduction<br>
of water had been the means of disturbing its equilibrium.  Then,<br>
impelled by its powerful screw, it attacked the ice-field from beneath<br>
like a formidable battering-ram.  It broke it by backing and then<br>
rushing forward against the field, which gradually gave way; and at<br>
last, dashing suddenly against it, shot forwards on the ice-field, that<br>
crushed beneath its weight.  The panel was opened--one might say torn<br>
off--and the pure air came in in abundance to all parts of the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVII<br>
<br>
FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON<br>
<br>
How I got on to the platform, I have no idea; perhaps the Canadian had<br>
carried me there.  But I breathed, I inhaled the vivifying sea-air.  My<br>
two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles.  The other<br>
unhappy men had been so long without food, that they could not with<br>
impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given them.  We, on<br>
the contrary, had no end to restrain ourselves; we could draw this air<br>
freely into our lungs, and it was the breeze, the breeze alone, that<br>
filled us with this keen enjoyment.<br>
<br>
"Ah!" said Conseil, "how delightful this oxygen is!  Master need not<br>
fear to breathe it.  There is enough for everybody."<br>
<br>
Ned Land did not speak, but he opened his jaws wide enough to frighten<br>
a shark.  Our strength soon returned, and, when I looked round me, I<br>
saw we were alone on the platform.  The foreign seamen in the Nautilus<br>
were contented with the air that circulated in the interior; none of<br>
them had come to drink in the open air.<br>
<br>
The first words I spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness to my<br>
two companions.  Ned and Conseil had prolonged my life during the last<br>
hours of this long agony.  All my gratitude could not repay such<br>
devotion.<br>
<br>
"My friends," said I, "we are bound one to the other for ever, and I am<br>
under infinite obligations to you."<br>
<br>
"Which I shall take advantage of," exclaimed the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"What do you mean?" said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"I mean that I shall take you with me when I leave this infernal<br>
Nautilus."<br>
<br>
"Well," said Conseil, "after all this, are we going right?"<br>
<br>
"Yes," I replied, "for we are going the way of the sun, and here the<br>
sun is in the north."<br>
<br>
"No doubt," said Ned Land; "but it remains to be seen whether he will<br>
bring the ship into the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, that is, into<br>
frequented or deserted seas."<br>
<br>
I could not answer that question, and I feared that Captain Nemo would<br>
rather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of Asia and<br>
America at the same time.  He would thus complete the tour round the<br>
submarine world, and return to those waters in which the Nautilus could<br>
sail freely.  We ought, before long, to settle this important point.<br>
The Nautilus went at a rapid pace.  The polar circle was soon passed,<br>
and the course shaped for Cape Horn.  We were off the American point,<br>
March 31st, at seven o'clock in the evening.  Then all our past<br>
sufferings were forgotten.  The remembrance of that imprisonment in the<br>
ice was effaced from our minds.  We only thought of the future.<br>
Captain Nemo did not appear again either in the drawing-room or on the<br>
platform.  The point shown each day on the planisphere, and, marked by<br>
the lieutenant, showed me the exact direction of the Nautilus.  Now, on<br>
that evening, it was evident, to, my great satisfaction, that we were<br>
going back to the North by the Atlantic.  The next day, April 1st, when<br>
the Nautilus ascended to the surface some minutes before noon, we<br>
sighted land to the west.  It was Terra del Fuego, which the first<br>
navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from<br>
the natives' huts.  The coast seemed low to me, but in the distance<br>
rose high mountains.  I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount<br>
Sarmiento, that rises 2,070 yards above the level of the sea, with a<br>
very pointed summit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a<br>
sign of fine or of wet weather.  At this moment the peak was clearly<br>
defined against the sky.  The Nautilus, diving again under the water,<br>
approached the coast, which was only some few miles off.  From the<br>
glass windows in the drawing-room, I saw long seaweeds and gigantic<br>
fuci and varech, of which the open polar sea contains so many<br>
specimens, with their sharp polished filaments; they measured about 300<br>
yards in length--real cables, thicker than one's thumb; and, having<br>
great tenacity, they are often used as ropes for vessels.  Another weed<br>
known as velp, with leaves four feet long, buried in the coral<br>
concretions, hung at the bottom.  It served as nest and food for<br>
myriads of crustacea and molluscs, crabs, and cuttlefish.  There seals<br><a href="../site4/page2_7130.html">link6_text</a>
and otters had splendid repasts, eating the flesh of fish with<br>
sea-vegetables, according to the English fashion.  Over this fertile<br>
and luxuriant ground the Nautilus passed with great rapidity.  Towards<br>
evening it approached the Falkland group, the rough summits of which I<br>
recognised the following day.  The depth of the sea was moderate.  On<br>
the shores our nets brought in beautiful specimens of sea weed, and<br>
particularly a certain fucus, the roots of which were filled with the<br>
best mussels in the world.  Geese and ducks fell by dozens on the<br>
platform, and soon took their places in the pantry on board.<br>
<br>
When the last heights of the Falklands had disappeared from the<br>
horizon, the Nautilus sank to between twenty and twenty-five yards, and<br>
followed the American coast.  Captain Nemo did not show himself.  Until<br>
the 3rd of April we did not quit the shores of Patagonia, sometimes<br>
under the ocean, sometimes at the surface.  The Nautilus passed beyond<br>
the large estuary formed by the Uraguay.  Its direction was northwards,<br>
and followed the long windings of the coast of South America.  We had<br>
then made 1,600 miles since our embarkation in the seas of Japan.<br>
About eleven o'clock in the morning the Tropic of Capricorn was crossed<br>
on the thirty-seventh meridian, and we passed Cape Frio standing out to<br>
sea.  Captain Nemo, to Ned Land's great displeasure, did not like the<br>
neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for we went at a giddy<br>
speed.  Not a fish, not a bird of the swiftest kind could follow us,<br>
and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all observation.<br>
<br>
This speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening of the 9th<br>
of April we sighted the most westerly point of South America that forms<br>
Cape San Roque.  But then the Nautilus swerved again, and sought the<br>
lowest depth of a submarine valley which is between this Cape and<br>
Sierra Leone on the African coast.  This valley bifurcates to the<br>
parallel of the Antilles, and terminates at the mouth by the enormous<br>
depression of 9,000 yards.  In this place, the geological basin of the<br>
ocean forms, as far as the Lesser Antilles, a cliff to three and a half<br>
miles perpendicular in height, and, at the parallel of the Cape Verde<br>
Islands, an other wall not less considerable, that encloses thus all<br>
the sunk continent of the Atlantic.  The bottom of this immense valley<br>
is dotted with some mountains, that give to these submarine places a<br>
picturesque aspect.  I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts that<br>
were in the library of the Nautilus--charts evidently due to Captain<br>
Nemo's hand, and made after his personal observations.  For two days<br>
the desert and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined<br>
planes.  The Nautilus was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which<br>
carried it to all elevations.  But on the 11th of April it rose<br>
suddenly, and land appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a vast<br>
estuary, the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens<br>
the sea-water for the distance of several leagues.<br>
<br>
The equator was crossed. Twenty miles to the west were the Guianas, a<br>
French territory, on which we could have found an easy refuge; but a<br>
stiff breeze was blowing, and the furious waves would not have allowed<br>
a single boat to face them. Ned Land understood that, no doubt, for he<br>
spoke not a word about it. For my part, I made no allusion to his<br>
schemes of flight, for I would not urge him to make an attempt that<br>
must inevitably fail. I made the time pass pleasantly by interesting<br>
studies.  During the days of April 11th and 12th, the Nautilus did not<br>
leave the surface of the sea, and the net brought in a marvellous haul<br>
of Zoophytes, fish and reptiles. Some zoophytes had been fished up by<br>
the chain of the nets; they were for the most part beautiful<br>
phyctallines, belonging to the actinidian family, and among other<br>
species the phyctalis protexta, peculiar to that part of the ocean,<br>
with a little cylindrical trunk, ornamented With vertical lines,<br>
speckled with red dots, crowning a marvellous blossoming of tentacles.<br>
As to the molluscs, they consisted of some I had already<br>
observed--turritellas, olive porphyras, with regular lines<br>
intercrossed, with red spots standing out plainly against the flesh;<br>
odd pteroceras, like petrified scorpions; translucid hyaleas,<br>
argonauts, cuttle-fish (excellent eating), and certain species of<br>
calmars that naturalists of antiquity have classed amongst the<br>
flying-fish, and that serve principally for bait for cod-fishing. I had<br>
now an opportunity of studying several species of fish on these shores.<br>
Amongst the cartilaginous ones, petromyzons-pricka, a sort of eel,<br>
fifteen inches long, with a greenish head, violet fins, grey-blue back,<br>
brown belly, silvered and sown with bright spots, the pupil of the eye<br>
encircled with gold--a curious animal, that the current of the Amazon<br>
had drawn to the sea, for they inhabit fresh waters--tuberculated<br>
streaks, with pointed snouts, and a long loose tail, armed with a long<br>
jagged sting; little sharks, a yard long, grey and whitish skin, and<br>
several rows of teeth, bent back, that are generally known by the name<br>
of pantouffles; vespertilios, a kind of red isosceles triangle, half a<br>
yard long, to which pectorals are attached by fleshy prolongations that<br>
make them look like bats, but that their horny appendage, situated near<br>
the nostrils, has given them the name of sea-unicorns; lastly, some<br>
species of balistae, the curassavian, whose spots were of a brilliant<br>
gold colour, and the capriscus of clear violet, and with varying shades<br>
like a pigeon's throat.<br>
<br>
I end here this catalogue, which is somewhat dry perhaps, but very<br>
exact, with a series of bony fish that I observed in passing belonging<br>
to the apteronotes, and whose snout is white as snow, the body of a<br>
beautiful black, marked with a very long loose fleshy strip;<br>
odontognathes, armed with spikes; sardines nine inches long, glittering<br>
with a bright silver light; a species of mackerel provided with two<br>
anal fins; centronotes of a blackish tint, that are fished for with<br>
torches, long fish, two yards in length, with fat flesh, white and<br>
firm, which, when they arc fresh, taste like eel, and when dry, like<br>
smoked salmon; labres, half red, covered with scales only at the bottom<br>
of the dorsal and anal fins; chrysoptera, on which gold and silver<br>
blend their brightness with that of the ruby and topaz; golden-tailed<br>
spares, the flesh of which is extremely delicate, and whose<br>
phosphorescent properties betray them in the midst of the waters;<br><a href="../site6/page2_7832.html">link7_text</a>
orange-coloured spares with long tongues; maigres, with gold caudal<br>
fins, dark thorn-tails, anableps of Surinam, etc.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding this "et cetera," I must not omit to mention fish that<br>
Conseil will long remember, and with good reason. One of our nets had<br>
hauled up a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off,<br>
formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces. It was white<br>
underneath, red above, with large round spots of dark blue encircled<br>
with black, very glossy skin, terminating in a bilobed fin. Laid out on<br>
the platform, it struggled, tried to turn itself by convulsive<br>
movements, and made so many efforts, that one last turn had nearly sent<br>
it into the sea. But Conseil, not wishing to let the fish go, rushed to<br>
it, and, before I could prevent him, had seized it with both hands. In<br>
a moment he was overthrown, his legs in the air, and half his body<br>
paralysed, crying--<br>
<br>
"Oh! master, master! help me!"<br>
<br>
It was the first time the poor boy had spoken to me so familiarly.  The<br>
Canadian and I took him up, and rubbed his contracted arms till he<br>
became sensible. The unfortunate Conseil had attacked a cramp-fish of<br>
the most dangerous kind, the cumana. This odd animal, in a medium<br>
conductor like water, strikes fish at several yards' distance, so great<br>
is the power of its electric organ, the two principal surfaces of which<br>
do not measure less than twenty-seven square feet. The next day, April<br>
12th, the Nautilus approached the Dutch coast, near the mouth of the<br>
Maroni. There several groups of sea-cows herded together; they were<br>
manatees, that, like the dugong and the stellera, belong to the skenian<br>
order. These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from<br>
eighteen to twenty-one feet in length, weigh at least sixteen<br>
hundredweight. I told Ned Land and Conseil that provident nature had<br>
assigned an important role to these mammalia. Indeed, they, like the<br>
seals, are designed to graze on the submarine prairies, and thus<br>
destroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers.<br>
<br>
"And do you know," I added, "what has been the result since men have<br>
almost entirely annihilated this useful race? That the putrefied weeds<br>
have poisoned the air, and the poisoned air causes the yellow fever,<br>
that desolates these beautiful countries. Enormous vegetations are<br>
multiplied under the torrid seas, and the evil is irresistibly<br>
developed from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida. If we are<br>
to believe Toussenel, this plague is nothing to what it would be if the<br>
seas were cleaned of whales and seals. Then, infested with poulps,<br>
medusae, and cuttle-fish, they would become immense centres of<br>
infection, since their waves would not possess 'these vast stomachs<br>
that God had charged to infest the surface of the seas.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<br>
THE POULPS<br>
<br>
For several days the Nautilus kept off from the American coast.<br>
Evidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the Gulf of Mexico or of<br>
the sea of the Antilles.  April 16th, we sighted Martinique and<br>
Guadaloupe from a distance of about thirty miles.  I saw their tall<br>
peaks for an instant.  The Canadian, who counted on carrying out his<br>
projects in the Gulf, by either landing or hailing one of the numerous<br>
boats that coast from one island to another, was quite disheartened.<br>
Flight would have been quite practicable, if Ned Land had been able to<br>
take possession of the boat without the Captain's knowledge.  But in<br>
the open sea it could not be thought of.  The Canadian, Conseil, and I<br>
had a long conversation on this subject.  For six months we had been<br>
prisoners on board the Nautilus.  We had travelled 17,000 leagues; and,<br>
as Ned Land said, there was no reason why it should come to an end.  We<br>
could hope nothing from the Captain of the Nautilus, but only from<br>
ourselves.  Besides, for some time past he had become graver, more<br>
retired, less sociable.  He seemed to shun me.  I met him rarely.<br>
Formerly he was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to me; now he<br>
left me to my studies, and came no more to the saloon.  What change had<br>
come over him?  For what cause?  For my part, I did not wish to bury<br>
with me my curious and novel studies.  I had now the power to write the<br>
true book of the sea; and this book, sooner or later, I wished to see<br>
daylight.  The land nearest us was the archipelago of the Bahamas.<br>
There rose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds.  It was<br>
about eleven o'clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a formidable<br>
pricking, like the sting of an ant, which was produced by means of<br>
large seaweeds.<br>
<br>
"Well," I said, "these are proper caverns for poulps, and I should not<br>
be astonished to see some of these monsters."<br>
<br>
"What!" said Conseil; "cuttlefish, real cuttlefish of the cephalopod<br>
class?"<br>
<br>
"No," I said, "poulps of huge dimensions."<br>
<br>
"I will never believe that such animals exist," said Ned.<br>
<br>
"Well," said Conseil, with the most serious air in the world, "I<br>
remember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by<br>
an octopus's arm."<br>
<br>
"You saw that?" said the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Yes, Ned."<br>
<br>
"With your own eyes?"<br>
<br><a href="../site4/page0_2550.html">link8_text</a>
"With my own eyes."<br>
<br>
"Where, pray, might that be?"<br>
<br>
"At St. Malo," answered Conseil.<br>
<br>
"In the port?" said Ned, ironically.<br>
<br>
"No; in a church," replied Conseil.<br>
<br>
"In a church!" cried the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Yes; friend Ned.  In a picture representing the poulp in question."<br>
<br>
"Good!" said Ned Land, bursting out laughing.<br>
<br>
"He is quite right," I said.  "I have heard of this picture; but the<br>
subject represented is taken from a legend, and you know what to think<br>
of legends in the matter of natural history.  Besides, when it is a<br>
question of monsters, the imagination is apt to run wild.  Not only is<br>
it supposed that these poulps can draw down vessels, but a certain<br>
Olaus Magnus speaks of an octopus a mile long that is more like an<br>
island than an animal.  It is also said that the Bishop of Nidros was<br>
building an altar on an immense rock.  Mass finished, the rock began to<br>
walk, and returned to the sea.  The rock was a poulp.  Another Bishop,<br>
Pontoppidan, speaks also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalry<br>
could manoeuvre.  Lastly, the ancient naturalists speak of monsters<br>
whose mouths were like gulfs, and which were too large to pass through<br>
the Straits of Gibraltar."<br>
<br>
"But how much is true of these stories?" asked Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Nothing, my friends; at least of that which passes the limit of truth<br>
to get to fable or legend.  Nevertheless, there must be some ground for<br>
the imagination of the story-tellers. One cannot deny that poulps and<br>
cuttlefish exist of a large species, inferior, however, to the<br>
cetaceans.  Aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five<br>
cubits, or nine feet two inches.  Our fishermen frequently see some<br>
that are more than four feet long.  Some skeletons of poulps are<br>
preserved in the museums of Trieste and Montpelier, that measure two<br>
yards in length.  Besides, according to the calculations of some<br>
naturalists, one of these animals only six feet long would have<br>
tentacles twenty-seven feet long.  That would suffice to make a<br>
formidable monster."<br>
<br>
"Do they fish for them in these days?" asked Ned.<br>
<br>
"If they do not fish for them, sailors see them at least.  One of my<br>
friends, Captain Paul Bos of Havre, has often affirmed that he met one<br>
of these monsters of colossal dimensions in the Indian seas.  But the<br>
most astonishing fact, and which does not permit of the denial of the<br>
existence of these gigantic animals, happened some years ago, in 1861."<br>
<br>
"What is the fact?" asked Ned Land.<br>
<br>
"This is it.  In 1861, to the north-east of Teneriffe, very nearly in<br>
the same latitude we are in now, the crew of the despatch-boat Alector<br>
perceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters.  Captain<br>
Bouguer went near to the animal, and attacked it with harpoon and guns,<br>
without much success, for balls and harpoons glided over the soft<br>
flesh.  After several fruitless attempts the crew tried to pass a<br>
slip-knot round the body of the mollusc.  The noose slipped as far as<br>
the tail fins and there stopped.  They tried then to haul it on board,<br>
but its weight was so considerable that the tightness of the cord<br>
separated the tail from the body, and, deprived of this ornament, he<br>
disappeared under the water."<br>
<br>
"Indeed! is that a fact?"<br>
<br>
"An indisputable fact, my good Ned.  They proposed to name this poulp<br>
`Bouguer's cuttlefish.'"<br>
<br>
"What length was it?" asked the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Did it not measure about six yards?" said Conseil, who, posted at the<br>
window, was examining again the irregular windings of the cliff.<br>
<br>
"Precisely," I replied.<br>
<br>
"Its head," rejoined Conseil, "was it not crowned with eight tentacles,<br>
that beat the water like a nest of serpents?"<br>
<br>
"Precisely."<br>
<br>
"Had not its eyes, placed at the back of its head, considerable<br>
development?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, Conseil."<br>
<br>
"And was not its mouth like a parrot's beak?"<br>
<br>
"Exactly, Conseil."<br>
<br>
"Very well! no offence to master," he replied, quietly; "if this is not<br>
Bouguer's cuttlefish, it is, at least, one of its brothers."<br>
<br>
I looked at Conseil.  Ned Land hurried to the window.<br>
<br>
"What a horrible beast!" he cried.<br>
<br><a href="../site4/page3_4460.html">link9_text</a>
I looked in my turn, and could not repress a gesture of disgust.<br>
Before my eyes was a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends<br>
of the marvellous.  It was an immense cuttlefish, being eight yards<br>
long.  It swam crossways in the direction of the Nautilus with great<br>
speed, watching us with its enormous staring green eyes.  Its eight<br>
arms, or rather feet, fixed to its head, that have given the name of<br>
cephalopod to these animals, were twice as long as its body, and were<br>
twisted like the furies' hair.  One could see the 250 air holes on the<br>
inner side of the tentacles.  The monster's mouth, a horned beak like a<br>
parrot's, opened and shut vertically.  Its tongue, a horned substance,<br>
furnished with several rows of pointed teeth, came out quivering from<br>
this veritable pair of shears.  What a freak of nature, a bird's beak<br>
on a mollusc!  Its spindle-like body formed a fleshy mass that might<br>
weigh 4,000 to 5,000 lb.; the, varying colour changing with great<br>
rapidity, according to the irritation of the animal, passed<br>
successively from livid grey to reddish brown.  What irritated this<br>
mollusc?  No doubt the presence of the Nautilus, more formidable than<br>
itself, and on which its suckers or its jaws had no hold.  Yet, what<br>
monsters these poulps are! what vitality the Creator has given them!<br>
what vigour in their movements! and they possess three hearts!  Chance<br>
had brought us in presence of this cuttlefish, and I did not wish to<br>
lose the opportunity of carefully studying this specimen of<br>
cephalopods.  I overcame the horror that inspired me, and, taking a<br>
pencil, began to draw it.<br>
<br>
"Perhaps this is the same which the Alector saw," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"No," replied the Canadian; "for this is whole, and the other had lost<br>
its tail."<br>
<br>
"That is no reason," I replied.  "The arms and tails of these animals<br>
are re-formed by renewal; and in seven years the tail of Bouguer's<br>
cuttlefish has no doubt had time to grow."<br>
<br>
By this time other poulps appeared at the port light.  I counted seven.<br>
They formed a procession after the Nautilus, and I heard their beaks<br>
gnashing against the iron hull.  I continued my work.  These monsters<br>
kept in the water with such precision that they seemed immovable.<br>
Suddenly the Nautilus stopped.  A shock made it tremble in every plate.<br>
<br>
"Have we struck anything?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"In any case," replied the Canadian, "we shall be free, for we are<br>
floating."<br>
<br>
The Nautilus was floating, no doubt, but it did not move.  A minute<br>
passed.  Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, entered the<br>
drawing-room. I had not seen him for some time.  He seemed dull.<br>
Without noticing or speaking to us, he went to the panel, looked at the<br>
poulps, and said something to his lieutenant.  The latter went out.<br>
Soon the panels were shut.  The ceiling was lighted.  I went towards<br>
the Captain.<br>
<br>
"A curious collection of poulps?"  I said.<br>
<br>
"Yes, indeed, Mr. Naturalist," he replied; "and we are going to fight<br>
them, man to beast."<br>
<br>
I looked at him.  I thought I had not heard aright.<br>
<br>
"Man to beast?"  I repeated.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir.  The screw is stopped.  I think that the horny jaws of one<br>
of the cuttlefish is entangled in the blades.  That is what prevents<br>
our moving."<br>
<br>
"What are you going to do?"<br>
<br>
"Rise to the surface, and slaughter this vermin."<br>
<br>
"A difficult enterprise."<br>
<br>
"Yes, indeed.  The electric bullets are powerless against the soft<br>
flesh, where they do not find resistance enough to go off.  But we<br>
shall attack them with the hatchet."<br>
<br>
"And the harpoon, sir," said the Canadian, "if you do not refuse my<br>
help."<br>
<br>
"I will accept it, Master Land."<br>
<br>
"We will follow you," I said, and, following Captain Nemo, we went<br>
towards the central staircase.<br>
<br>
There, about ten men with boarding-hatchets were ready for the attack.<br>
Conseil and I took two hatchets; Ned Land seized a harpoon.  The<br>
Nautilus had then risen to the surface.  One of the sailors, posted on<br>
the top ladderstep, unscrewed the bolts of the panels.  But hardly were<br>
the screws loosed, when the panel rose with great violence, evidently<br>
drawn by the suckers of a poulp's arm.  Immediately one of these arms<br>
slid like a serpent down the opening and twenty others were above.<br>
With one blow of the axe, Captain Nemo cut this formidable tentacle,<br>
that slid wriggling down the ladder.  Just as we were pressing one on<br>
the other to reach the platform, two other arms, lashing the air, came<br>
down on the seaman placed before Captain Nemo, and lifted him up with<br>
irresistible power.  Captain Nemo uttered a cry, and rushed out.  We<br>
hurried after him.<br>
<br>
What a scene!  The unhappy man, seized by the tentacle and fixed to the<br>
suckers, was balanced in the air at the caprice of this enormous trunk.<br><a href="../site7/page3_8282.html">link10_text</a>
