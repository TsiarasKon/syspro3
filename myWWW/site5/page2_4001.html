inclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea.<br>
<br>
On the 18th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, we were at<br>
the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar.  There once existed two<br>
currents: an upper one, long since recognised, which conveys the waters<br>
of the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; and a lower<br>
counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist.  Indeed, the<br>
volume of water in the Mediterranean, incessantly added to by the waves<br>
of the Atlantic and by rivers falling into it, would each year raise<br>
the level of this sea, for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore<br>
the equilibrium.  As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the<br>
existence of an under-current, which empties into the basin of the<br>
Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar the surplus waters of the<br>
Mediterranean.  A fact indeed; and it was this counter-current by which<br>
the Nautilus profited.  It advanced rapidly by the narrow pass.  For<br>
one instant I caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of<br>
Hercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low<br>
island which supports it; and a few minutes later we were floating on<br>
the Atlantic.<br>
<br>

<br>
CHAPTER VIII<br>
<br>
VIGO BAY<br>
<br>
The Atlantic! a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers<br>
twenty-five millions of square miles, the length of which is nine<br>
thousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred--an<br>
ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference,<br>
watered by the largest rivers of the world, the St. Lawrence, the<br>
Mississippi, the Amazon, the Plata, the Orinoco, the Niger, the<br>
Senegal, the Elbe, the Loire, and the Rhine, which carry water from the<br>
most civilised, as well as from the most savage, countries!<br>
Magnificent field of water, incessantly ploughed by vessels of every<br>
nation, sheltered by the flags of every nation, and which terminates in<br>
those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners, Cape Horn and the<br>
Cape of Tempests.<br>
<br>
The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having<br>
accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a<br>
distance greater than the great circle of the earth.  Where were we<br>
going now, and what was reserved for the future?  The Nautilus, leaving<br>
the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone far out.  It returned to the surface<br>
of the waves, and our daily walks on the platform were restored to us.<br>
<br>
I mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil.  At a distance<br>
of about twelve miles, Cape St. Vincent was dimly to be seen, forming<br>
the south-western point of the Spanish peninsula.  A strong southerly<br>
gale was blowing.  The sea was swollen and billowy; it made the<br>
Nautilus rock violently.  It was almost impossible to keep one's foot<br>
on the platform, which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every<br>
instant.  So we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air.<br>
<br>
I returned to my room, Conseil to his cabin; but the Canadian, with a<br>
preoccupied air, followed me.  Our rapid passage across the<br>
Mediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution,<br>
and he could not help showing his disappointment.  When the door of my<br>
room was shut, he sat down and looked at me silently.<br>
<br>
"Friend Ned," said I, "I understand you; but you cannot reproach<br>
yourself.  To have attempted to leave the Nautilus under the<br>
circumstances would have been folly."<br>
<br>
Ned Land did not answer; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed<br>
with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind.<br>
<br>
"Let us see," I continued; "we need not despair yet.  We are going up<br>
the coast of Portugal again; France and England are not far off, where<br>
we can easily find refuge.  Now if the Nautilus, on leaving the Straits<br>
of Gibraltar, had gone to the south, if it had carried us towards<br>
regions where there were no continents, I should share your uneasiness.<br>
But we know now that Captain Nemo does not fly from civilised seas, and<br>
in some days I think you can act with security."<br>
<br>
Ned Land still looked at me fixedly; at length his fixed lips parted,<br>
and he said, "It is for to-night."<br>
<br>
I drew myself up suddenly.  I was, I admit, little prepared for this<br>
communication.  I wanted to answer the Canadian, but words would not<br>
come.<br>
<br>
"We agreed to wait for an opportunity," continued Ned Land, "and the<br>
opportunity has arrived.  This night we shall be but a few miles from<br>
the Spanish coast.  It is cloudy.  The wind blows freely.  I have your<br>
word, M. Aronnax, and I rely upon you."<br>
<br>
As I was silent, the Canadian approached me.<br>
<br>
"To-night, at nine o'clock," said he.  "I have warned Conseil.  At that<br>
moment Captain Nemo will be shut up in his room, probably in bed.<br>
Neither the engineers nor the ship's crew can see us.  Conseil and I<br>
will gain the central staircase, and you, M. Aronnax, will remain in<br>
the library, two steps from us, waiting my signal.  The oars, the mast,<br>
and the sail are in the canoe.  I have even succeeded in getting some<br>
provisions.  I have procured an English wrench, to unfasten the bolts<br>
which attach it to the shell of the Nautilus.  So all is ready, till<br>
to-night."<br>
<br>
"The sea is bad."<br>
<br>
"That I allow," replied the Canadian; "but we must risk that.  Liberty<br>
is worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with<br>
a fair wind to carry us is no great thing.  Who knows but by to-morrow<br>
we may be a hundred leagues away?  Let circumstances only favour us,<br>
and by ten or eleven o'clock we shall have landed on some spot of terra<br>
firma, alive or dead.  But adieu now till to-night."<br>
<br>
With these words the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost dumb.  I had<br>
imagined that, the chance gone, I should have time to reflect and<br>
discuss the matter.  My obstinate companion had given me no time; and,<br>
after all, what could I have said to him?  Ned Land was perfectly<br>
right.  There was almost the opportunity to profit by.  Could I retract<br>
my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the<br>
future of my companions?  To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from<br>
all land.<br>
<br>
At that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs<br>
were filling, and that the Nautilus was sinking under the waves of the<br>
Atlantic.<br>
<br>
A sad day I passed, between the desire of regaining my liberty of<br>
action and of abandoning the wonderful Nautilus, and leaving my<br>
submarine studies incomplete.<br>
<br>
What dreadful hours I passed thus!  Sometimes seeing myself and<br>
companions safely landed, sometimes wishing, in spite of my reason,<br>
that some unforeseen circumstance, would prevent the realisation of Ned<br>
Land's project.<br>
<br>
Twice I went to the saloon.  I wished to consult the compass.  I wished<br>
to see if the direction the Nautilus was taking was bringing us nearer<br>
or taking us farther from the coast.  But no; the Nautilus kept in<br>
Portuguese waters.<br>
<br>
I must therefore take my part and prepare for flight.  My luggage was<br>
not heavy; my notes, nothing more.<br><a href="../site2/page0_6685.html">link1_text</a>
<br>
As to Captain Nemo, I asked myself what he would think of our escape;<br>
what trouble, what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in<br>
case of its discovery or failure.  Certainly I had no cause to complain<br>
of him; on the contrary, never was hospitality freer than his.  In<br>
leaving him I could not be taxed with ingratitude.  No oath bound us to<br>
him.  It was on the strength of circumstances he relied, and not upon<br>
our word, to fix us for ever.<br>
<br>
I had not seen the Captain since our visit to the Island of Santorin.<br>
Would chance bring me to his presence before our departure?  I wished<br>
it, and I feared it at the same time.  I listened if I could hear him<br>
walking the room contiguous to mine.  No sound reached my ear.  I felt<br>
an unbearable uneasiness.  This day of waiting seemed eternal.  Hours<br>
struck too slowly to keep pace with my impatience.<br>
<br>
My dinner was served in my room as usual.  I ate but little; I was too<br>
preoccupied.  I left the table at seven o'clock. A hundred and twenty<br>
minutes (I counted them) still separated me from the moment in which I<br>
was to join Ned Land.  My agitation redoubled.  My pulse beat<br>
violently.  I could not remain quiet.  I went and came, hoping to calm<br>
my troubled spirit by constant movement.  The idea of failure in our<br>
bold enterprise was the least painful of my anxieties; but the thought<br>
of seeing our project discovered before leaving the Nautilus, of being<br>
brought before Captain Nemo, irritated, or (what was worse) saddened,<br>
at my desertion, made my heart beat.<br>
<br>
I wanted to see the saloon for the last time.  I descended the stairs<br>
and arrived in the museum, where I had passed so many useful and<br>
agreeable hours.  I looked at all its riches, all its treasures, like a<br>
man on the eve of an eternal exile, who was leaving never to return.<br>
<br>
These wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for<br>
so many days my life had been concentrated, I was going to abandon them<br>
for ever!  I should like to have taken a last look through the windows<br>
of the saloon into the waters of the Atlantic:  but the panels were<br>
hermetically closed, and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean<br>
which I had not yet explored.<br>
<br>
In passing through the saloon, I came near the door let into the angle<br>
which opened into the Captain's room.  To my great surprise, this door<br>
was ajar.  I drew back involuntarily.  If Captain Nemo should be in his<br>
room, he could see me.  But, hearing no sound, I drew nearer.  The room<br>
was deserted.  I pushed open the door and took some steps forward.<br>
Still the same monklike severity of aspect.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the clock struck eight.  The first beat of the hammer on the<br>
bell awoke me from my dreams.  I trembled as if an invisible eye had<br>
plunged into my most secret thoughts, and I hurried from the room.<br>
<br>
There my eye fell upon the compass.  Our course was still north.  The<br>
log indicated moderate speed, the manometer a depth of about sixty feet.<br>
<br>
I returned to my room, clothed myself warmly--sea boots, an otterskin<br>
cap, a great coat of byssus, lined with sealskin; I was ready, I was<br>
waiting.  The vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which<br>
reigned on board.  I listened attentively.  Would no loud voice<br>
suddenly inform me that Ned Land had been surprised in his projected<br>
flight.  A mortal dread hung over me, and I vainly tried to regain my<br>
accustomed coolness.<br>
<br>
At a few minutes to nine, I put my ear to the Captain's door.  No<br>
noise.  I left my room and returned to the saloon, which was half in<br>
obscurity, but deserted.<br>
<br>
I opened the door communicating with the library.  The same<br>
insufficient light, the same solitude.  I placed myself near the door<br>
leading to the central staircase, and there waited for Ned Land's<br>
signal.<br>
<br>
At that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished, then it<br>
stopped entirely.  The silence was now only disturbed by the beatings<br>
of my own heart.  Suddenly a slight shock was felt; and I knew that the<br>
Nautilus had stopped at the bottom of the ocean.  My uneasiness<br>
increased.  The Canadian's signal did not come.  I felt inclined to<br>
join Ned Land and beg of him to put off his attempt.  I felt that we<br>
were not sailing under our usual conditions.<br>
<br>
At this moment the door of the large saloon opened, and Captain Nemo<br>
appeared.  He saw me, and without further preamble began in an amiable<br>
tone of voice:<br>
<br>
"Ah, sir!  I have been looking for you.  Do you know the history of<br>
Spain?"<br>
<br>
Now, one might know the history of one's own country by heart; but in<br>
the condition I was at the time, with troubled mind and head quite<br>
lost, I could not have said a word of it.<br>
<br>
"Well," continued Captain Nemo, "you heard my question!  Do you know<br>
the history of Spain?"<br>
<br>
"Very slightly," I answered.<br>
<br>
"Well, here are learned men having to learn," said the Captain.  "Come,<br>
sit down, and I will tell you a curious episode in this history.  Sir,<br>
listen well," said he; "this history will interest you on one side, for<br>
it will answer a question which doubtless you have not been able to<br>
solve."<br>
<br>
"I listen, Captain," said I, not knowing what my interlocutor was<br>
driving at, and asking myself if this incident was bearing on our<br>
projected flight.<br>
<br>
"Sir, if you have no objection, we will go back to 1702.  You cannot be<br>
ignorant that your king, Louis XIV, thinking that the gesture of a<br>
potentate was sufficient to bring the Pyrenees under his yoke, had<br>
imposed the Duke of Anjou, his grandson, on the Spaniards.  This prince<br>
reigned more or less badly under the name of Philip V, and had a strong<br>
party against him abroad.  Indeed, the preceding year, the royal houses<br>
of Holland, Austria, and England had concluded a treaty of alliance at<br>
the Hague, with the intention of plucking the crown of Spain from the<br>
head of Philip V, and placing it on that of an archduke to whom they<br>
prematurely gave the title of Charles III.<br>
<br>
"Spain must resist this coalition; but she was almost entirely<br>
unprovided with either soldiers or sailors.  However, money would not<br>
fail them, provided that their galleons, laden with gold and silver<br>
from America, once entered their ports.  And about the end of 1702 they<br>
expected a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet of<br>
twenty-three vessels, commanded by Admiral Chateau-Renaud, for the<br>
ships of the coalition were already beating the Atlantic.  This convoy<br>
was to go to Cadiz, but the Admiral, hearing that an English fleet was<br>
cruising in those waters, resolved to make for a French port.<br>
<br>
"The Spanish commanders of the convoy objected to this decision.  They<br>
wanted to be taken to a Spanish port, and, if not to Cadiz, into Vigo<br>
Bay, situated on the northwest coast of Spain, and which was not<br>
blocked.<br>
<br>
"Admiral Chateau-Renaud had the rashness to obey this injunction, and<br>
the galleons entered Vigo Bay.<br>
<br>
"Unfortunately, it formed an open road which could not be defended in<br>
any way.  They must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the<br>
arrival of the combined fleet; and time would not have failed them had<br><a href="../site7/page1_6035.html">link2_text</a>
not a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen.<br>
<br>
"You are following the chain of events?" asked Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
"Perfectly," said I, not knowing the end proposed by this historical<br>
lesson.<br>
<br>
"I will continue.  This is what passed.  The merchants of Cadiz had a<br>
privilege by which they had the right of receiving all merchandise<br>
coming from the West Indies.  Now, to disembark these ingots at the<br>
port of Vigo was depriving them of their rights.  They complained at<br>
Madrid, and obtained the consent of the weak-minded Philip that the<br>
convoy, without discharging its cargo, should remain sequestered in the<br>
roads of Vigo until the enemy had disappeared.<br>
<br>
"But whilst coming to this decision, on the 22nd of October, 1702, the<br>
English vessels arrived in Vigo Bay, when Admiral Chateau-Renaud, in<br>
spite of inferior forces, fought bravely.  But, seeing that the<br>
treasure must fall into the enemy's hands, he burnt and scuttled every<br>
galleon, which went to the bottom with their immense riches."<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo stopped.  I admit I could not see yet why this history<br>
should interest me.<br>
<br>
"Well?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Well, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, "we are in that Vigo Bay; and<br>
it rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries."<br>
<br>
The Captain rose, telling me to follow him.  I had had time to recover.<br>
I obeyed.  The saloon was dark, but through the transparent glass the<br>
waves were sparkling.  I looked.<br>
<br>
For half a mile around the Nautilus, the waters seemed bathed in<br>
electric light.  The sandy bottom was clean and bright.  Some of the<br>
ship's crew in their diving-dresses were clearing away half-rotten<br>
barrels and empty cases from the midst of the blackened wrecks.  From<br>
these cases and from these barrels escaped ingots of gold and silver,<br>
cascades of piastres and jewels.  The sand was heaped up with them.<br>
Laden with their precious booty, the men returned to the Nautilus,<br>
disposed of their burden, and went back to this inexhaustible fishery<br>
of gold and silver.<br>
<br>
I understood now.  This was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of<br>
October, 1702.  Here on this very spot the galleons laden for the<br>
Spanish Government had sunk.  Here Captain Nemo came, according to his<br>
wants, to pack up those millions with which he burdened the Nautilus.<br>
It was for him and him alone America had given up her precious metals.<br>
He was heir direct, without anyone to share, in those treasures torn<br>
from the Incas and from the conquered of Ferdinand Cortez.<br>
<br>
"Did you know, sir," he asked, smiling, "that the sea contained such<br>
riches?"<br>
<br>
"I knew," I answered, "that they value money held in suspension in<br>
these waters at two millions."<br>
<br>
"Doubtless; but to extract this money the expense would be greater than<br>
the profit.  Here, on the contrary, I have but to pick up what man has<br>
lost--and not only in Vigo Bay, but in a thousand other ports where<br>
shipwrecks have happened, and which are marked on my submarine map.<br>
Can you understand now the source of the millions I am worth?"<br>
<br>
"I understand, Captain.  But allow me to tell you that in exploring<br>
Vigo Bay you have only been beforehand with a rival society."<br>
<br>
"And which?"<br>
<br>
"A society which has received from the Spanish Government the privilege<br>
of seeking those buried galleons.  The shareholders are led on by the<br>
allurement of an enormous bounty, for they value these rich shipwrecks<br>
at five hundred millions."<br>
<br>
"Five hundred millions they were," answered Captain Nemo, "but they are<br>
so no longer."<br>
<br>
"Just so," said I; "and a warning to those shareholders would be an act<br>
of charity.  But who knows if it would be well received?  What gamblers<br>
usually regret above all is less the loss of their money than of their<br>
foolish hopes.  After all, I pity them less than the thousands of<br>
unfortunates to whom so much riches well-distributed would have been<br>
profitable, whilst for them they will be for ever barren."<br>
<br>
I had no sooner expressed this regret than I felt that it must have<br>
wounded Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
"Barren!" he exclaimed, with animation.  "Do you think then, sir, that<br>
these riches are lost because I gather them?  Is it for myself alone,<br>
according to your idea, that I take the trouble to collect these<br>
treasures?  Who told you that I did not make a good use of it?  Do you<br>
think I am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races<br>
on this earth, miserable creatures to console, victims to avenge?  Do<br>
you not understand?"<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo stopped at these last words, regretting perhaps that he<br>
had spoken so much.  But I had guessed that, whatever the motive which<br>
had forced him to seek independence under the sea, it had left him<br>
still a man, that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity,<br>
and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as<br>
individuals.  And I then understood for whom those millions were<br>
destined which were forwarded by Captain Nemo when the Nautilus was<br>
cruising in the waters of Crete.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX<br>
<br>
A VANISHED CONTINENT<br>
<br>
The next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my<br>
room.  I expected this visit.  He looked very disappointed.<br>
<br>
"Well, sir?" said he.<br>
<br>
"Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday."<br>
<br>
"Yes; that Captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended<br>
leaving his vessel."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Ned, he had business at his bankers."<br>
<br>
"His bankers!"<br>
<br>
"Or rather his banking-house; by that I mean the ocean, where his<br>
riches are safer than in the chests of the State."<br>
<br>
I then related to the Canadian the incidents of the preceding night,<br>
hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but<br>
my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret<br>
from Ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of<br>
Vigo on his own account.<br>
<br>
"However," said he, "all is not ended.  It is only a blow of the<br>
harpoon lost.  Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if<br>
necessary----"<br>
<br><a href="../site5/page4_3458.html">link3_text</a>
"In what direction is the Nautilus going?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"I do not know," replied Ned.<br>
<br>
"Well, at noon we shall see the point."<br>
<br>
The Canadian returned to Conseil.  As soon as I was dressed, I went<br>
into the saloon.  The compass was not reassuring.  The course of the<br>
Nautilus was S.S.W. We were turning our backs on Europe.<br>
<br>
I waited with some impatience till the ship's place was pricked on the<br>
chart.  At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and our<br>
vessel rose to the surface of the ocean.  I rushed towards the<br>
platform.  Ned Land had preceded me.  No more land in sight.  Nothing<br>
but an immense sea.  Some sails on the horizon, doubtless those going<br>
to San Roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of<br>
Good Hope.  The weather was cloudy.  A gale of wind was preparing.  Ned<br>
raved, and tried to pierce the cloudy horizon.  He still hoped that<br>
behind all that fog stretched the land he so longed for.<br>
<br>
At noon the sun showed itself for an instant.  The second profited by<br>
this brightness to take its height.  Then, the sea becoming more<br>
billowy, we descended, and the panel closed.<br>
<br>
An hour after, upon consulting the chart, I saw the position of the<br>
Nautilus was marked at 16° 17' long., and 33° 22' lat., at 150<br>
leagues from the nearest coast.  There was no means of flight, and I<br>
leave you to imagine the rage of the Canadian when I informed him of<br>
our situation.<br>
<br>
For myself, I was not particularly sorry.  I felt lightened of the load<br>
which had oppressed me, and was able to return with some degree of<br>
calmness to my accustomed work.<br>
<br>
That night, about eleven o'clock, I received a most unexpected visit<br>
from Captain Nemo.  He asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from<br>
my watch of the preceding night.  I answered in the negative.<br>
<br>
"Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion."<br>
<br>
"Propose, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"You have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight, under<br>
the brightness of the sun.  Would it suit you to see them in the<br>
darkness of the night?"<br>
<br>
"Most willingly."<br>
<br>
"I warn you, the way will be tiring.  We shall have far to walk, and<br>
must climb a mountain.  The roads are not well kept."<br>
<br>
"What you say, Captain, only heightens my curiosity; I am ready to<br>
follow you."<br>
<br>
"Come then, sir, we will put on our diving-dresses."<br>
<br>
Arrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any<br>
of the ship's crew were to follow us on this excursion.  Captain Nemo<br>
had not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil.<br>
<br>
In a few moments we had put on our diving-dresses; they placed on our<br>
backs the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps<br>
were prepared.  I called the Captain's attention to the fact.<br>
<br>
"They will be useless," he replied.<br>
<br>
I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my<br>
observation, for the Captain's head had already disappeared in its<br>
metal case.  I finished harnessing myself.  I felt them put an<br>
iron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going<br>
through the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a<br>
depth of 150 fathoms.  Midnight was near.  The waters were profoundly<br>
dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a<br>
sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the<br>
Nautilus.  What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it<br>
lit up the liquid mass, I could not say.  In any case, it did light our<br>
way, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar<br>
darkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness<br>
of the Ruhmkorff apparatus.<br>
<br>
As we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head.  The noise<br>
redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood<br>
the cause.  It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of<br>
the waves.  Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I<br>
should be wet through!  By the water! in the midst of the water!  I<br>
could not help laughing at the odd idea.  But, indeed, in the thick<br>
diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems<br>
to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere.<br>
Nothing more.<br>
<br>
After half an hour's walk the soil became stony.  Medusae, microscopic<br>
crustacea, and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent<br>
gleam.  I caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of<br>
zoophytes and masses of sea weed.  My feet often slipped upon this<br>
sticky carpet of sea weed, and without my iron-tipped stick I should<br>
have fallen more than once.  In turning round, I could still see the<br>
whitish lantern of the Nautilus beginning to pale in the distance.<br>
<br>
But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon.<br>
The presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree.<br>
Was I going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the _savants_<br>
of the earth?  Or even (for this thought crossed my brain) had the hand<br>
of man aught to do with this conflagration?  Had he fanned this flame?<br>
Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of Captain Nemo<br>
whom he was going to visit, and who, like him, led this strange<br>
existence?  Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who,<br>
weary of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence<br>
in the deep ocean?  All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued<br>
me.  And in this condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of<br>
wonders continually passing before my eyes, I should not have been<br>
surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns<br>
of which Captain Nemo dreamed.<br>
<br>
Our road grew lighter and lighter.  The white glimmer came in rays from<br>
the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high.  But what I saw was<br>
simply a reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters.  The<br>
source of this inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of<br>
the mountain.<br>
<br>
In the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic,<br>
Captain Nemo advanced without hesitation.  He knew this dreary road.<br>
Doubtless he had often travelled over it, and could not lose himself.<br>
I followed him with unshaken confidence.  He seemed to me like a genie<br>
of the sea; and, as he walked before me, I could not help admiring his<br>
stature, which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon.<br>
<br>
It was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the<br>
mountain; but to gain access to them we must venture through the<br>
difficult paths of a vast copse.<br>
<br>
Yes; a copse of dead trees, without leaves, without sap, trees<br>
petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by<br>
gigantic pines.  It was like a coal-pit still standing, holding by the<br>
roots to the broken soil, and whose branches, like fine black paper<br>
cuttings, showed distinctly on the watery ceiling.  Picture to yourself<br>
a forest in the Hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain, but a<br><a href="../site2/page3_4537.html">link4_text</a>
forest swallowed up.  The paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus,<br>
between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea.  I went along,<br>
climbing the rocks, striding over extended trunks, breaking the sea<br>
bind-weed which hung from one tree to the other; and frightening the<br>
fishes, which flew from branch to branch.  Pressing onward, I felt no<br>
fatigue.  I followed my guide, who was never tired.  What a spectacle!<br>
How can I express it? how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in<br>
this medium--their under parts dark and wild, the upper coloured with<br>
red tints, by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters<br>
doubled?  We climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic<br>
bounds and the low growling of an avalanche.  To right and left ran<br>
long, dark galleries, where sight was lost.  Here opened vast glades<br>
which the hand of man seemed to have worked; and I sometimes asked<br>
myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly<br>
appear to me.<br>
<br>
But Captain Nemo was still mounting.  I could not stay behind.  I<br>
followed boldly.  My stick gave me good help.  A false step would have<br>
been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the<br>
gulfs; but I walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness.  Now<br>
I jumped a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had<br>
it been among the glaciers on the land; now I ventured on the unsteady<br>
trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without<br>
looking under my feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of<br>
this region.<br>
<br>
There, monumental rocks, leaning on their regularly-cut bases, seemed<br>
to defy all laws of equilibrium.  From between their stony knees trees<br>
sprang, like a jet under heavy pressure, and upheld others which upheld<br>
them.  Natural towers, large scarps, cut perpendicularly, like a<br>
"curtain," inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could<br>
never have tolerated in terrestrial regions.<br>
<br>
Two hours after quitting the Nautilus we had crossed the line of trees,<br>
and a hundred feet above our heads rose the top of the mountain, which<br>
cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope.  Some<br>
petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there.  Fishes got up under<br>
our feet like birds in the long grass.  The massive rocks were rent<br>
with impenetrable fractures, deep grottos, and unfathomable holes, at<br>
the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving.  My<br>
blood curdled when I saw enormous antennae blocking my road, or some<br>
frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity.<br>
Millions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness.<br>
They were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their holes; giant<br>
lobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers, and moving their claws<br>
with the clicking sound of pincers; titanic crabs, pointed like a gun<br>
on its carriage; and frightful-looking poulps, interweaving their<br>
tentacles like a living nest of serpents.<br>
<br>
We had now arrived on the first platform, where other surprises awaited<br>
me.  Before us lay some picturesque ruins, which betrayed the hand of<br>
man and not that of the Creator.  There were vast heaps of stone,<br>
amongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles<br>
and temples, clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes, and over<br>
which, instead of ivy, sea-weed and fucus threw a thick vegetable<br>
mantle.  But what was this portion of the globe which had been<br>
swallowed by cataclysms?  Who had placed those rocks and stones like<br>
cromlechs of prehistoric times?  Where was I?  Whither had Captain<br>
Nemo's fancy hurried me?<br>
<br>
I would fain have asked him; not being able to, I stopped him--I seized<br>
his arm.  But, shaking his head, and pointing to the highest point of<br>
the mountain, he seemed to say:<br>
<br>
"Come, come along; come higher!"<br>
<br>
I followed, and in a few minutes I had climbed to the top, which for a<br>
circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock.<br>
<br>
I looked down the side we had just climbed.  The mountain did not rise<br>
more than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain; but<br>
on the opposite side it commanded from twice that height the depths of<br>
this part of the Atlantic.  My eyes ranged far over a large space lit<br>
by a violent fulguration.  In fact, the mountain was a volcano.<br>
<br>
At fifty feet above the peak, in the midst of a rain of stones and<br>
scoriae, a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell<br>
in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass.  Thus situated,<br>
this volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch, even to the<br>
extreme limits of the horizon.  I said that the submarine crater threw<br>
up lava, but no flames.  Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed<br>
upon and cannot be developed under water; but streams of lava, having<br>
in themselves the principles of their incandescence, can attain a white<br>
heat, fight vigorously against the liquid element, and turn it to<br>
vapour by contact.<br>
<br>
Rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of<br>
lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on<br>
another Terra del Greco.<br>
<br>
There indeed under my eyes, ruined, destroyed, lay a town--its roofs<br>
open to the sky, its temples fallen, its arches dislocated, its columns<br>
lying on the ground, from which one would still recognise the massive<br>
character of Tuscan architecture.  Further on, some remains of a<br>
gigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the<br>
floating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if an<br>
ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and<br>
disappeared with its merchant vessels and its war-galleys. Farther on<br>
again, long lines of sunken walls and broad, deserted streets--a<br>
perfect Pompeii escaped beneath the waters.  Such was the sight that<br>
Captain Nemo brought before my eyes!<br>
<br>
Where was I?  Where was I?  I must know at any cost.  I tried to speak,<br>
but Captain Nemo stopped me by a gesture, and, picking up a piece of<br>
chalk-stone, advanced to a rock of black basalt, and traced the one<br>
word:<br>
<br>
<br>
ATLANTIS<br>
<br>
<br>
What a light shot through my mind!  Atlantis! the Atlantis of Plato,<br>
that continent denied by Origen and Humbolt, who placed its<br>
disappearance amongst the legendary tales.  I had it there now before<br>
my eyes, bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its<br>
catastrophe.  The region thus engulfed was beyond Europe, Asia, and<br>
Lybia, beyond the columns of Hercules, where those powerful people, the<br>
Atlantides, lived, against whom the first wars of ancient Greeks were<br>
waged.<br>
<br>
Thus, led by the strangest destiny, I was treading under foot the<br>
mountains of this continent, touching with my hand those ruins a<br>
thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs.<br>
I was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first<br>
man had walked.<br>
<br>
Whilst I was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand<br>
landscape, Captain Nemo remained motionless, as if petrified in mute<br>
ecstasy, leaning on a mossy stone.  Was he dreaming of those<br>
generations long since disappeared?  Was he asking them the secret of<br>
human destiny?  Was it here this strange man came to steep himself in<br>
historical recollections, and live again this ancient life--he who<br>
wanted no modern one?  What would I not have given to know his<br>
thoughts, to share them, to understand them!  We remained for an hour<br>
at this place, contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of<br>
the lava, which was some times wonderfully intense.  Rapid tremblings<br><a href="../site5/page1_7366.html">link5_text</a>
ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings, deep noise,<br>
distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with<br>
majestic grandeur.  At this moment the moon appeared through the mass<br>
of waters and threw her pale rays on the buried continent.  It was but<br>
a gleam, but what an indescribable effect!  The Captain rose, cast one<br>
last look on the immense plain, and then bade me follow him.<br>
<br>
We descended the mountain rapidly, and, the mineral forest once passed,<br>
I saw the lantern of the Nautilus shining like a star.  The Captain<br>
walked straight to it, and we got on board as the first rays of light<br>
whitened the surface of the ocean.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER X<br>
<br>
THE SUBMARINE COAL-MINES<br>
<br>
The next day, the 20th of February, I awoke very late:  the fatigues of<br>
the previous night had prolonged my sleep until eleven o'clock. I<br>
dressed quickly, and hastened to find the course the Nautilus was<br>
taking.  The instruments showed it to be still toward the south, with a<br>
speed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms.<br>
<br>
The species of fishes here did not differ much from those already<br>
noticed.  There were rays of giant size, five yards long, and endowed<br>
with great muscular strength, which enabled them to shoot above the<br>
waves; sharks of many kinds; amongst others, one fifteen feet long,<br>
with triangular sharp teeth, and whose transparency rendered it almost<br>
invisible in the water.<br>
<br>
Amongst bony fish Conseil noticed some about three yards long, armed at<br>
the upper jaw with a piercing sword; other bright-coloured creatures,<br>
known in the time of Aristotle by the name of the sea-dragon, which are<br>
dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back.<br>
<br>
About four o'clock, the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed<br>
with petrified wood, changed by degrees, and it became more stony, and<br>
seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt, with a sprinkling<br>
of lava.  I thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long<br>
plains; and accordingly, after a few evolutions of the Nautilus, I saw<br>
the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close all<br>
exit.  Its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean.  It must be<br>
a continent, or at least an island--one of the Canaries, or of the Cape<br>
Verde Islands.  The bearings not being yet taken, perhaps designedly, I<br>
was ignorant of our exact position.  In any case, such a wall seemed to<br>
me to mark the limits of that Atlantis, of which we had in reality<br>
passed over only the smallest part.<br>
<br>
Much longer should I have remained at the window admiring the beauties<br>
of sea and sky, but the panels closed.  At this moment the Nautilus<br>
arrived at the side of this high, perpendicular wall.  What it would<br>
do, I could not guess.  I returned to my room; it no longer moved.  I<br>
laid myself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours'<br>
sleep; but it was eight o'clock the next day when I entered the saloon.<br>
I looked at the manometer.  It told me that the Nautilus was floating<br>
on the surface of the ocean.  Besides, I heard steps on the platform.<br>
I went to the panel.  It was open; but, instead of broad daylight, as I<br>
expected, I was surrounded by profound darkness.  Where were we?  Was I<br>
mistaken?  Was it still night?  No; not a star was shining and night<br>
has not that utter darkness.<br>
<br>
I knew not what to think, when a voice near me said:<br>
<br>
"Is that you, Professor?"<br>
<br>
"Ah!  Captain," I answered, "where are we?"<br>
<br>
"Underground, sir."<br>
<br>
"Underground!"  I exclaimed.  "And the Nautilus floating still?"<br>
<br>
"It always floats."<br>
<br>
"But I do not understand."<br>
<br>
"Wait a few minutes, our lantern will be lit, and, if you like light<br>
places, you will be satisfied."<br>
<br>
I stood on the platform and waited.  The darkness was so complete that<br>
I could not even see Captain Nemo; but, looking to the zenith, exactly<br>
above my head, I seemed to catch an undecided gleam, a kind of twilight<br>
filling a circular hole.  At this instant the lantern was lit, and its<br>
vividness dispelled the faint light.  I closed my dazzled eyes for an<br>
instant, and then looked again.  The Nautilus was stationary, floating<br>
near a mountain which formed a sort of quay.  The lake, then,<br>
supporting it was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls, measuring two<br>
miles in diameter and six in circumference.  Its level (the manometer<br>
showed) could only be the same as the outside level, for there must<br>
necessarily be a communication between the lake and the sea.  The high<br>
partitions, leaning forward on their base, grew into a vaulted roof<br>
bearing the shape of an immense funnel turned upside down, the height<br>
being about five or six hundred yards.  At the summit was a circular<br>
orifice, by which I had caught the slight gleam of light, evidently<br>
daylight.<br>
<br>
"Where are we?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"In the very heart of an extinct volcano, the interior of which has<br>
been invaded by the sea, after some great convulsion of the earth.<br>
Whilst you were sleeping, Professor, the Nautilus penetrated to this<br>
lagoon by a natural canal, which opens about ten yards beneath the<br>
surface of the ocean.  This is its harbour of refuge, a sure,<br>
commodious, and mysterious one, sheltered from all gales.  Show me, if<br>
you can, on the coasts of any of your continents or islands, a road<br>
which can give such perfect refuge from all storms."<br>
<br>
"Certainly," I replied, "you are in safety here, Captain Nemo.  Who<br>
could reach you in the heart of a volcano?  But did I not see an<br>
opening at its summit?"<br>
<br>
"Yes; its crater, formerly filled with lava, vapour, and flames, and<br>
which now gives entrance to the life-giving air we breathe."<br>
<br>
"But what is this volcanic mountain?"<br>
<br>
"It belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is<br>
strewn--to vessels a simple sandbank--to us an immense cavern.  Chance<br>
led me to discover it, and chance served me well."<br>
<br>
"But of what use is this refuge, Captain?  The Nautilus wants no port."<br>
<br>
"No, sir; but it wants electricity to make it move, and the wherewithal<br>
to make the electricity--sodium to feed the elements, coal from which<br>
to get the sodium, and a coal-mine to supply the coal.  And exactly on<br>
this spot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological<br>
periods, now mineralised and transformed into coal; for me they are an<br>
inexhaustible mine."<br>
<br>
"Your men follow the trade of miners here, then, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"Exactly so.  These mines extend under the waves like the mines of<br>
Newcastle.  Here, in their diving-dresses, pick axe and shovel in hand,<br>
my men extract the coal, which I do not even ask from the mines of the<br>
earth.  When I burn this combustible for the manufacture of sodium, the<br>
smoke, escaping from the crater of the mountain, gives it the<br><a href="../site3/page6_1726.html">link6_text</a>
appearance of a still-active volcano."<br>
<br>
"And we shall see your companions at work?"<br>
<br>
"No; not this time at least; for I am in a hurry to continue our<br>
submarine tour of the earth.  So I shall content myself with drawing<br>
from the reserve of sodium I already possess.  The time for loading is<br>
one day only, and we continue our voyage.  So, if you wish to go over<br>
the cavern and make the round of the lagoon, you must take advantage of<br>
to-day, M. Aronnax."<br>
<br>
I thanked the Captain and went to look for my companions, who had not<br>
yet left their cabin.  I invited them to follow me without saying where<br>
we were.  They mounted the platform.  Conseil, who was astonished at<br>
nothing, seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake<br>
under a mountain, after having fallen asleep under the waves.  But Ned<br>
Land thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit.<br>
After breakfast, about ten o'clock, we went down on to the mountain.<br>
<br>
"Here we are, once more on land," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"I do not call this land," said the Canadian.  "And besides, we are not<br>
on it, but beneath it."<br>
<br>
Between the walls of the mountains and the waters of the lake lay a<br>
sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet.<br>
On this soil one might easily make the tour of the lake.  But the base<br>
of the high partitions was stony ground, with volcanic locks and<br>
enormous pumice-stones lying in picturesque heaps.  All these detached<br>
masses, covered with enamel, polished by the action of the<br>
subterraneous fires, shone resplendent by the light of our electric<br>
lantern.  The mica dust from the shore, rising under our feet, flew<br>
like a cloud of sparks.  The bottom now rose sensibly, and we soon<br>
arrived at long circuitous slopes, or inclined planes, which took us<br>
higher by degrees; but we were obliged to walk carefully among these<br>
conglomerates, bound by no cement, the feet slipping on the glassy<br>
crystal, felspar, and quartz.<br>
<br>
The volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was confirmed on all<br>
sides, and I pointed it out to my companions.<br>
<br>
"Picture to yourselves," said I, "what this crater must have been when<br>
filled with boiling lava, and when the level of the incandescent liquid<br>
rose to the orifice of the mountain, as though melted on the top of a<br>
hot plate."<br>
<br>
"I can picture it perfectly," said Conseil.  "But, sir, will you tell<br>
me why the Great Architect has suspended operations, and how it is that<br>
the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake?"<br>
<br>
"Most probably, Conseil, because some convulsion beneath the ocean<br>
produced that very opening which has served as a passage for the<br>
Nautilus.  Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed into the interior of<br>
the mountain.  There must have been a terrible struggle between the two<br>
elements, a struggle which ended in the victory of Neptune.  But many<br>
ages have run out since then, and the submerged volcano is now a<br>
peaceable grotto."<br>
<br>
"Very well," replied Ned Land; "I accept the explanation, sir; but, in<br>
our own interests, I regret that the opening of which you speak was not<br>
made above the level of the sea."<br>
<br>
"But, friend Ned," said Conseil, "if the passage had not been under the<br>
sea, the Nautilus could not have gone through it."<br>
<br>
We continued ascending.  The steps became more and more perpendicular<br>
and narrow.  Deep excavations, which we were obliged to cross, cut them<br>
here and there; sloping masses had to be turned.  We slid upon our<br>
knees and crawled along.  But Conseil's dexterity and the Canadian's<br>
strength surmounted all obstacles.  At a height of about 31 feet the<br>
nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable.  To the<br>
conglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt, the first dispread in<br>
layers full of bubbles, the latter forming regular prisms, placed like<br>
a colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault, an admirable<br>
specimen of natural architecture.  Between the blocks of basalt wound<br>
long streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous<br>
rays; and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur.  A<br>
more powerful light shone through the upper crater, shedding a vague<br>
glimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of<br>
this extinguished mountain.  But our upward march was soon stopped at a<br>
height of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles.<br>
There was a complete vaulted arch overhanging us, and our ascent was<br>
changed to a circular walk.  At the last change vegetable life began to<br>
struggle with the mineral.  Some shrubs, and even some trees, grew from<br>
the fractures of the walls.  I recognised some euphorbias, with the<br>
caustic sugar coming from them; heliotropes, quite incapable of<br>
justifying their name, sadly drooped their clusters of flowers, both<br>
their colour and perfume half gone.  Here and there some chrysanthemums<br>
grew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long, sickly-looking leaves.<br>
But between the streams of lava, I saw some little violets still<br>
slightly perfumed, and I admit that I smelt them with delight.  Perfume<br>
is the soul of the flower, and sea-flowers have no soul.<br>
<br>
We had arrived at the foot of some sturdy dragon-trees, which had<br>
pushed aside the rocks with their strong roots, when Ned Land exclaimed:<br>
<br>
"Ah! sir, a hive! a hive!"<br>
<br>
"A hive!"  I replied, with a gesture of incredulity.<br>
<br>
"Yes, a hive," repeated the Canadian, "and bees humming round it."<br>
<br>
I approached, and was bound to believe my own eyes.  There at a hole<br>
bored in one of the dragon-trees were some thousands of these ingenious<br>
insects, so common in all the Canaries, and whose produce is so much<br>
esteemed.  Naturally enough, the Canadian wished to gather the honey,<br>
and I could not well oppose his wish.  A quantity of dry leaves, mixed<br>
with sulphur, he lit with a spark from his flint, and he began to smoke<br>
out the bees.  The humming ceased by degrees, and the hive eventually<br>
yielded several pounds of the sweetest honey, with which Ned Land<br>
filled his haversack.<br>
<br>
"When I have mixed this honey with the paste of the bread-fruit," said<br>
he, "I shall be able to offer you a succulent cake."<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's Note: 'bread-fruit' has been substituted for<br>
'artocarpus' in this ed.]<br>
<br>
"'Pon my word," said Conseil, "it will be gingerbread."<br>
<br>
"Never mind the gingerbread," said I; "let us continue our interesting<br>
walk."<br>
<br>
At every turn of the path we were following, the lake appeared in all<br>
its length and breadth.  The lantern lit up the whole of its peaceable<br>
surface, which knew neither ripple nor wave.  The Nautilus remained<br>
perfectly immovable.  On the platform, and on the mountain, the ship's<br>
crew were working like black shadows clearly carved against the<br>
luminous atmosphere.  We were now going round the highest crest of the<br>
first layers of rock which upheld the roof.  I then saw that bees were<br>
not the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of<br>
this volcano.  Birds of prey hovered here and there in the shadows, or<br>
fled from their nests on the top of the rocks.  There were sparrow<br>
hawks, with white breasts, and kestrels, and down the slopes scampered,<br>
with their long legs, several fine fat bustards.  I leave anyone to<br>
imagine the covetousness of the Canadian at the sight of this savoury<br><a href="../site5/page8_2953.html">link7_text</a>
game, and whether he did not regret having no gun.  But he did his best<br>
to replace the lead by stones, and, after several fruitless attempts,<br>
he succeeded in wounding a magnificent bird.  To say that he risked his<br>
life twenty times before reaching it is but the truth; but he managed<br>
so well that the creature joined the honey-cakes in his bag.  We were<br>
now obliged to descend toward the shore, the crest becoming<br>
impracticable.  Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a<br>
well.  From this place the sky could be clearly seen, and clouds,<br>
dissipated by the west wind, leaving behind them, even on the summit of<br>
the mountain, their misty remnants--certain proof that they were only<br>
moderately high, for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred<br>
feet above the level of the ocean.  Half an hour after the Canadian's<br>
last exploit we had regained the inner shore.  Here the flora was<br>
represented by large carpets of marine crystal, a little umbelliferous<br>
plant very good to pickle, which also bears the name of pierce-stone<br>
and sea-fennel. Conseil gathered some bundles of it.  As to the fauna,<br>
it might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts, lobsters,<br>
crabs, spider-crabs, chameleon shrimps, and a large number of shells,<br>
rockfish, and limpets.  Three-quarters of an hour later we had finished<br>
our circuitous walk and were on board.  The crew had just finished<br>
loading the sodium, and the Nautilus could have left that instant.  But<br>
Captain Nemo gave no order.  Did he wish to wait until night, and leave<br>
the submarine passage secretly?  Perhaps so.  Whatever it might be, the<br>
next day, the Nautilus, having left its port, steered clear of all land<br>
at a few yards beneath the waves of the Atlantic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XI<br>
<br>
THE SARGASSO SEA<br>
<br>
That day the Nautilus crossed a singular part of the Atlantic Ocean.<br>
No one can be ignorant of the existence of a current of warm water<br>
known by the name of the Gulf Stream.  After leaving the Gulf of<br>
Florida, we went in the direction of Spitzbergen.  But before entering<br>
the Gulf of Mexico, about 45° of N. lat., this current divides into<br>
two arms, the principal one going towards the coast of Ireland and<br>
Norway, whilst the second bends to the south about the height of the<br>
Azores; then, touching the African shore, and describing a lengthened<br>
oval, returns to the Antilles.  This second arm--it is rather a collar<br>
than an arm--surrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of<br>
the cold, quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect<br>
lake in the open Atlantic: it takes no less than three years for the<br>
great current to pass round it.  Such was the region the Nautilus was<br>
now visiting, a perfect meadow, a close carpet of seaweed, fucus, and<br>
tropical berries, so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel<br>
could hardly tear its way through it.  And Captain Nemo, not wishing to<br>
entangle his screw in this herbaceous mass, kept some yards beneath the<br>
surface of the waves.  The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word<br>
"sargazzo" which signifies kelp.  This kelp, or berry-plant, is the<br>
principal formation of this immense bank.  And this is the reason why<br>
these plants unite in the peaceful basin of the Atlantic.  The only<br>
explanation which can be given, he says, seems to me to result from the<br>
experience known to all the world.  Place in a vase some fragments of<br>
cork or other floating body, and give to the water in the vase a<br>
circular movement, the scattered fragments will unite in a group in the<br>
centre of the liquid surface, that is to say, in the part least<br>
agitated.  In the phenomenon we are considering, the Atlantic is the<br>
vase, the Gulf Stream the circular current, and the Sargasso Sea the<br>
central point at which the floating bodies unite.<br>
<br>
I share Maury's opinion, and I was able to study the phenomenon in the<br>
very midst, where vessels rarely penetrate.  Above us floated products<br>
of all kinds, heaped up among these brownish plants; trunks of trees<br>
torn from the Andes or the Rocky Mountains, and floated by the Amazon<br>
or the Mississippi; numerous wrecks, remains of keels, or ships'<br>
bottoms, side-planks stove in, and so weighted with shells and<br>
barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface.  And time will<br>
one day justify Maury's other opinion, that these substances thus<br>
accumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water<br>
and will then form inexhaustible coal-mines--a precious reserve<br>
prepared by far-seeing Nature for the moment when men shall have<br>
exhausted the mines of continents.<br>
<br>
In the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed, I<br>
noticed some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long<br>
tentacles trailing after them, and medusae, green, red, and blue.<br>
<br>
All the day of the 22nd of February we passed in the Sargasso Sea,<br>
where such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant<br>
nourishment.  The next, the ocean had returned to its accustomed<br>
aspect.  From this time for nineteen days, from the 23rd of February to<br>
the 12th of March, the Nautilus kept in the middle of the Atlantic,<br>
carrying us at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twenty-four<br>
hours.  Captain Nemo evidently intended accomplishing his submarine<br>
programme, and I imagined that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn,<br>
to return to the Australian seas of the Pacific.  Ned Land had cause<br>
for fear.  In these large seas, void of islands, we could not attempt<br>
to leave the boat.  Nor had we any means of opposing Captain Nemo's<br>
will.  Our only course was to submit; but what we could neither gain by<br>
force nor cunning, I liked to think might be obtained by persuasion.<br>
This voyage ended, would he not consent to restore our liberty, under<br>
an oath never to reveal his existence?--an oath of honour which we<br>
should have religiously kept.  But we must consider that delicate<br>
question with the Captain.  But was I free to claim this liberty?  Had<br>
he not himself said from the beginning, in the firmest manner, that the<br>
secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board<br>
the Nautilus?  And would not my four months' silence appear to him a<br>
tacit acceptance of our situation?  And would not a return to the<br>
subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our<br>
projects, if at some future time a favourable opportunity offered to<br>
return to them?<br>
<br>
During the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind<br>
happened to signalise our voyage.  I saw little of the Captain; he was<br>
at work.  In the library I often found his books left open, especially<br>
those on natural history.  My work on submarine depths, conned over by<br>
him, was covered with marginal notes, often contradicting my theories<br>
and systems; but the Captain contented himself with thus purging my<br>
work; it was very rare for him to discuss it with me.  Sometimes I<br>
heard the melancholy tones of his organ; but only at night, in the<br>
midst of the deepest obscurity, when the Nautilus slept upon the<br>
deserted ocean.  During this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on<br>
the surface of the waves.  The sea seemed abandoned.  A few<br>
sailing-vessels, on the road to India, were making for the Cape of Good<br>
Hope.  One day we were followed by the boats of a whaler, who, no<br>
doubt, took us for some enormous whale of great price; but Captain Nemo<br>
did not wish the worthy fellows to lose their time and trouble, so<br>
ended the chase by plunging under the water.  Our navigation continued<br>
until the 13th of March; that day the Nautilus was employed in taking<br>
soundings, which greatly interested me.  We had then made about 13,000<br>
leagues since our departure from the high seas of the Pacific.  The<br>
bearings gave us 45° 37' S. lat., and 37° 53' W. long.  It was<br>
the same water in which Captain Denham of the Herald sounded 7,000<br>
fathoms without finding the bottom.  There, too, Lieutenant Parker, of<br>
the American frigate Congress, could not touch the bottom with 15,140<br>
fathoms.  Captain Nemo intended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a<br>
diagonal sufficiently lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at<br>
an angle of 45° with the water-line of the Nautilus.  Then the<br>
screw set to work at its maximum speed, its four blades beating the<br>
waves with in describable force.  Under this powerful pressure, the<br>
hull of the Nautilus quivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly<br>
under the water.<br>
<br>
At 7,000 fathoms I saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the<br><a href="../site5/page0_1643.html">link8_text</a>
waters; but these summits might belong to high mountains like the<br>
Himalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss<br>
remained incalculable.  The Nautilus descended still lower, in spite of<br>
the great pressure.  I felt the steel plates tremble at the fastenings<br>
of the bolts; its bars bent, its partitions groaned; the windows of the<br>
saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of the waters.  And this firm<br>
structure would doubtless have yielded, if, as its Captain had said, it<br>
had not been capable of resistance like a solid block.  We had attained<br>
a depth of 16,000 yards (four leagues), and the sides of the Nautilus<br>
then bore a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, that is to say, 3,200 lb.<br>
to each square two-fifths of an inch of its surface.<br>
<br>
"What a situation to be in!"  I exclaimed.  "To overrun these deep<br>
regions where man has never trod!  Look, Captain, look at these<br>
magnificent rocks, these uninhabited grottoes, these lowest receptacles<br>
of the globe, where life is no longer possible!  What unknown sights<br>
are here!  Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?"<br>
<br>
"Would you like to carry away more than the remembrance?" said Captain<br>
Nemo.<br>
<br>
"What do you mean by those words?"<br>
<br>
"I mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view<br>
of this submarine region."<br>
<br>
I had not time to express my surprise at this new proposition, when, at<br>
Captain Nemo's call, an objective was brought into the saloon.  Through<br>
the widely-opened panel, the liquid mass was bright with electricity,<br>
which was distributed with such uniformity that not a shadow, not a<br>
gradation, was to be seen in our manufactured light.  The Nautilus<br>
remained motionless, the force of its screw subdued by the inclination<br>
of its planes: the instrument was propped on the bottom of the oceanic<br>
site, and in a few seconds we had obtained a perfect negative.<br>
<br>
But, the operation being over, Captain Nemo said, "Let us go up; we<br>
must not abuse our position, nor expose the Nautilus too long to such<br>
great pressure."<br>
<br>
"Go up again!"  I exclaimed.<br>
<br>
"Hold well on."<br>
<br>
I had not time to understand why the Captain cautioned me thus, when I<br>
was thrown forward on to the carpet.  At a signal from the Captain, its<br>
screw was shipped, and its blades raised vertically; the Nautilus shot<br>
into the air like a balloon, rising with stunning rapidity, and cutting<br>
the mass of waters with a sonorous agitation.  Nothing was visible; and<br>
in four minutes it had shot through the four leagues which separated it<br>
from the ocean, and, after emerging like a flying-fish, fell, making<br>
the waves rebound to an enormous height.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XII<br>
<br>
CACHALOTS AND WHALES<br>
<br>
During the nights of the 13th and 14th of March, the Nautilus returned<br>
to its southerly course.  I fancied that, when on a level with Cape<br>
Horn, he would turn the helm westward, in order to beat the Pacific<br>
seas, and so complete the tour of the world.  He did nothing of the<br>
kind, but continued on his way to the southern regions.  Where was he<br>
going to?  To the pole?  It was madness!  I began to think that the<br>
Captain's temerity justified Ned Land's fears.  For some time past the<br>
Canadian had not spoken to me of his projects of flight; he was less<br>
communicative, almost silent.  I could see that this lengthened<br>
imprisonment was weighing upon him, and I felt that rage was burning<br>
within him.  When he met the Captain, his eyes lit up with suppressed<br>
anger; and I feared that his natural violence would lead him into some<br>
extreme.  That day, the 14th of March, Conseil and he came to me in my<br>
room.  I inquired the cause of their visit.<br>
<br>
"A simple question to ask you, sir," replied the Canadian.<br>
<br>
"Speak, Ned."<br>
<br>
"How many men are there on board the Nautilus, do you think?"<br>
<br>
"I cannot tell, my friend."<br>
<br>
"I should say that its working does not require a large crew."<br>
<br>
"Certainly, under existing conditions, ten men, at the most, ought to<br>
be enough."<br>
<br>
"Well, why should there be any more?"<br>
<br>
"Why?"  I replied, looking fixedly at Ned Land, whose meaning was easy<br>
to guess.  "Because," I added, "if my surmises are correct, and if I<br>
have well understood the Captain's existence, the Nautilus is not only<br>
a vessel: it is also a place of refuge for those who, like its<br>
commander, have broken every tie upon earth."<br>
<br>
"Perhaps so," said Conseil; "but, in any case, the Nautilus can only<br>
contain a certain number of men.  Could not you, sir, estimate their<br>
maximum?"<br>
<br>
"How, Conseil?"<br>
<br>
"By calculation; given the size of the vessel, which you know, sir, and<br>
consequently the quantity of air it contains, knowing also how much<br>
each man expends at a breath, and comparing these results with the fact<br>
that the Nautilus is obliged to go to the surface every twenty-four<br>
hours."<br>
<br>
Conseil had not finished the sentence before I saw what he was driving<br>
at.<br>
<br>
"I understand," said I; "but that calculation, though simple enough,<br>
can give but a very uncertain result."<br>
<br>
"Never mind," said Ned Land urgently.<br>
<br>
"Here it is, then," said I. "In one hour each man consumes the oxygen<br>
contained in twenty gallons of air; and in twenty-four, that contained<br>
in 480 gallons.  We must, therefore find how many times 480 gallons of<br>
air the Nautilus contains."<br>
<br>
"Just so," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Or," I continued, "the size of the Nautilus being 1,500 tons; and one<br>
ton holding 200 gallons, it contains 300,000 gallons of air, which,<br>
divided by 480, gives a quotient of 625.  Which means to say, strictly<br>
speaking, that the air contained in the Nautilus would suffice for 625<br>
men for twenty-four hours."<br>
<br>
"Six hundred and twenty-five!" repeated Ned.<br>
<br>
"But remember that all of us, passengers, sailors, and officers<br>
included, would not form a tenth part of that number."<br>
<br>
"Still too many for three men," murmured Conseil.<br>
<br>
The Canadian shook his head, passed his hand across his forehead, and<br>
left the room without answering.<br><a href="../site5/page7_5113.html">link9_text</a>
<br>
"Will you allow me to make one observation, sir?" said Conseil.  "Poor<br>
Ned is longing for everything that he can not have.  His past life is<br>
always present to him; everything that we are forbidden he regrets.<br>
His head is full of old recollections.  And we must understand him.<br>
What has he to do here?  Nothing; he is not learned like you, sir; and<br>
has not the same taste for the beauties of the sea that we have.  He<br>
would risk everything to be able to go once more into a tavern in his<br>
own country."<br>
<br>
Certainly the monotony on board must seem intolerable to the Canadian,<br>
accustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity.  Events were<br>
rare which could rouse him to any show of spirit; but that day an event<br>
did happen which recalled the bright days of the harpooner.  About<br>
eleven in the morning, being on the surface of the ocean, the Nautilus<br>
fell in with a troop of whales--an encounter which did not astonish me,<br>
knowing that these creatures, hunted to death, had taken refuge in high<br>
latitudes.<br>
<br>
We were seated on the platform, with a quiet sea.  The month of October<br>
in those latitudes gave us some lovely autumnal days.  It was the<br>
Canadian--he could not be mistaken--who signalled a whale on the<br>
eastern horizon.  Looking attentively, one might see its black back<br>
rise and fall with the waves five miles from the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
"Ah!" exclaimed Ned Land, "if I was on board a whaler, now such a<br>
meeting would give me pleasure.  It is one of large size.  See with<br>
what strength its blow-holes throw up columns of air an steam!<br>
Confound it, why am I bound to these steel plates?"<br>
<br>
"What, Ned," said I, "you have not forgotten your old ideas of fishing?"<br>
<br>
"Can a whale-fisher ever forget his old trade, sir?  Can he ever tire<br>
of the emotions caused by such a chase?"<br>
<br>
"You have never fished in these seas, Ned?"<br>
<br>
"Never, sir; in the northern only, and as much in Behring as in Davis<br>
Straits."<br>
<br>
"Then the southern whale is still unknown to you.  It is the Greenland<br>
whale you have hunted up to this time, and that would not risk passing<br>
through the warm waters of the equator.  Whales are localised,<br>
according to their kinds, in certain seas which they never leave.  And<br>
if one of these creatures went from Behring to Davis Straits, it must<br>
be simply because there is a passage from one sea to the other, either<br>
on the American or the Asiatic side."<br>
<br>
"In that case, as I have never fished in these seas, I do not know the<br>
kind of whale frequenting them!"<br>
<br>
"I have told you, Ned."<br>
<br>
"A greater reason for making their acquaintance," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Look! look!" exclaimed the Canadian, "they approach: they aggravate<br>
me; they know that I cannot get at them!"<br>
<br>
Ned stamped his feet.  His hand trembled, as he grasped an imaginary<br>
harpoon.<br>
<br>
"Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas?" asked he.<br>
<br>
"Very nearly, Ned."<br>
<br>
"Because I have seen large whales, sir, whales measuring a hundred<br>
feet.  I have even been told that those of Hullamoch and Umgallick, of<br>
the Aleutian Islands, are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long."<br>
<br>
"That seems to me exaggeration. These creatures are only<br>
balaeaopterons, provided with dorsal fins; and, like the cachalots, are<br>
generally much smaller than the Greenland whale."<br>
<br>
"Ah!" exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes had never left the ocean,<br>
"they are coming nearer; they are in the same water as the Nautilus."<br>
<br>
Then, returning to the conversation, he said:<br>
<br>
"You spoke of the cachalot as a small creature.  I have heard of<br>
gigantic ones.  They are intelligent cetacea.  It is said of some that<br>
they cover themselves with seaweed and fucus, and then are taken for<br>
islands.  People encamp upon them, and settle there; lights a fire----"<br>
<br>
"And build houses," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"Yes, joker," said Ned Land.  "And one fine day the creature plunges,<br>
carrying with it all the inhabitants to the bottom of the sea."<br>
<br>
"Something like the travels of Sinbad the Sailor," I replied, laughing.<br>
<br>
"Ah!" suddenly exclaimed Ned Land, "it is not one whale; there are<br>
ten--there are twenty--it is a whole troop!  And I not able to do<br>
anything! hands and feet tied!"<br>
<br>
"But, friend Ned," said Conseil, "why do you not ask Captain Nemo's<br>
permission to chase them?"<br>
<br>
Conseil had not finished his sentence when Ned Land had lowered himself<br>
through the panel to seek the Captain.  A few minutes afterwards the<br>
two appeared together on the platform.<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo watched the troop of cetacea playing on the waters about a<br>
mile from the Nautilus.<br>
<br>
"They are southern whales," said he; "there goes the fortune of a whole<br>
fleet of whalers."<br>
<br>
"Well, sir," asked the Canadian, "can I not chase them, if only to<br>
remind me of my old trade of harpooner?"<br>
<br>
"And to what purpose?" replied Captain Nemo; "only to destroy!  We have<br>
nothing to do with the whale-oil on board."<br>
<br>
"But, sir," continued the Canadian, "in the Red Sea you allowed us to<br>
follow the dugong."<br>
<br>
"Then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew.  Here it would be<br>
killing for killing's sake.  I know that is a privilege reserved for<br>
man, but I do not approve of such murderous pastime.  In destroying the<br>
southern whale (like the Greenland whale, an inoffensive creature),<br>
your traders do a culpable action, Master Land.  They have already<br>
depopulated the whole of Baffin's Bay, and are annihilating a class of<br>
useful animals.  Leave the unfortunate cetacea alone.  They have plenty<br>
of natural enemies--cachalots, swordfish, and sawfish--without you<br>
troubling them."<br>
<br>
The Captain was right.  The barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these<br>
fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the<br>
ocean.  Ned Land whistled "Yankee-doodle" between his teeth, thrust his<br>
hands into his pockets, and turned his back upon us.  But Captain Nemo<br>
watched the troop of cetacea, and, addressing me, said:<br>
<br>
"I was right in saying that whales had natural enemies enough, without<br>
counting man.  These will have plenty to do before long.  Do you see,<br>
M. Aronnax, about eight miles to leeward, those blackish moving points?"<br>
