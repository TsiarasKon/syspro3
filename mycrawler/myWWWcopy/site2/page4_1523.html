opportunity?"<br>
<br>
"It will be that which, on a dark night, will bring the Nautilus a<br>
short distance from some European coast."<br>
<br>
"And you will try and save yourself by swimming?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, if we were near enough to the bank, and if the vessel was<br>
floating at the time.  Not if the bank was far away, and the boat was<br>
under the water."<br>
<br>
"And in that case?"<br>
<br>
"In that case, I should seek to make myself master of the pinnace.  I<br>
know how it is worked.  We must get inside, and the bolts once drawn,<br>
we shall come to the surface of the water, without even the pilot, who<br>
is in the bows, perceiving our flight."<br>
<br>
"Well, Ned, watch for the opportunity; but do not forget that a hitch<br>
will ruin us."<br>
<br>
"I will not forget, sir."<br>
<br>
"And now, Ned, would you like to know what I think of your project?"<br>
<br>
"Certainly, M. Aronnax."<br>
<br>
"Well, I think--I do not say I hope--I think that this favourable<br>
opportunity will never present itself."<br>
<br>
"Why not?"<br>
<br>
"Because Captain Nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given<br>
up all hope of regaining our liberty, and he will be on his guard,<br>
above all, in the seas and in the sight of European coasts."<br>
<br>
"We shall see," replied Ned Land, shaking his head determinedly.<br>
<br>
"And now, Ned Land," I added, "let us stop here.  Not another word on<br>
the subject.  The day that you are ready, come and let us know, and we<br>
will follow you.  I rely entirely upon you."<br>
<br>
Thus ended a conversation which, at no very distant time, led to such<br>
grave results.  I must say here that facts seemed to confirm my<br>
foresight, to the Canadian's great despair.  Did Captain Nemo distrust<br>
us in these frequented seas? or did he only wish to hide himself from<br>
the numerous vessels, of all nations, which ploughed the Mediterranean?<br>
I could not tell; but we were oftener between waters and far from the<br>
coast.  Or, if the Nautilus did emerge, nothing was to be seen but the<br>
pilot's cage; and sometimes it went to great depths, for, between the<br>
Grecian Archipelago and Asia Minor we could not touch the bottom by<br>
more than a thousand fathoms.<br>
<br>
Thus I only knew we were near the Island of Carpathos, one of the<br>
Sporades, by Captain Nemo reciting these lines from Virgil:<br>
<br>
    "Est Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates,<br>
     Caeruleus Proteus,"<br>
<br>
as he pointed to a spot on the planisphere.<br>
<br>
It was indeed the ancient abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of<br>
Neptune's flocks, now the Island of Scarpanto, situated between Rhodes<br>
and Crete.  I saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels<br>
of the saloon.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 14th of February, I resolved to employ some hours in<br>
studying the fishes of the Archipelago; but for some reason or other<br>
the panels remained hermetically sealed.  Upon taking the course of the<br>
Nautilus, I found that we were going towards Candia, the ancient Isle<br>
of Crete.  At the time I embarked on the Abraham Lincoln, the whole of<br>
this island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the<br>
Turks.  But how the insurgents had fared since that time I was<br>
absolutely ignorant, and it was not Captain Nemo, deprived of all land<br>
communications, who could tell me.<br>
<br>
I made no allusion to this event when that night I found myself alone<br>
with him in the saloon.  Besides, he seemed to be taciturn and<br>
preoccupied.  Then, contrary to his custom, he ordered both panels to<br>
be opened, and, going from one to the other, observed the mass of<br>
waters attentively.  To what end I could not guess; so, on my side, I<br>
employed my time in studying the fish passing before my eyes.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the waters a man appeared, a diver, carrying at his<br>
belt a leathern purse.  It was not a body abandoned to the waves; it<br>
was a living man, swimming with a strong hand, disappearing<br>
occasionally to take breath at the surface.<br>
<br>
I turned towards Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice exclaimed:<br>
<br>
"A man shipwrecked!  He must be saved at any price!"<br>
<br>
The Captain did not answer me, but came and leaned against the panel.<br>
<br>
The man had approached, and, with his face flattened against the glass,<br>
was looking at us.<br>
<br>
To my great amazement, Captain Nemo signed to him.  The diver answered<br>
with his hand, mounted immediately to the surface of the water, and did<br>
not appear again.<br>
<br>
"Do not be uncomfortable," said Captain Nemo.  "It is Nicholas of Cape<br>
Matapan, surnamed Pesca.  He is well known in all the Cyclades.  A bold<br>
diver! water is his element, and he lives more in it than on land,<br>
going continually from one island to another, even as far as Crete."<br>
<br>
"You know him, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"Why not, M. Aronnax?"<br>
<br>
Saying which, Captain Nemo went towards a piece of furniture standing<br>
near the left panel of the saloon.  Near this piece of furniture, I saw<br>
a chest bound with iron, on the cover of which was a copper plate,<br>
bearing the cypher of the Nautilus with its device.<br>
<br>
At that moment, the Captain, without noticing my presence, opened the<br>
piece of furniture, a sort of strong box, which held a great many<br>
ingots.<br>
<br>
They were ingots of gold.  From whence came this precious metal, which<br><a href="../site2/page7_2110.html">link1_text</a>
represented an enormous sum?  Where did the Captain gather this gold<br>
from? and what was he going to do with it?<br>
<br>
I did not say one word.  I looked.  Captain Nemo took the ingots one by<br>
one, and arranged them methodically in the chest, which he filled<br>
entirely.  I estimated the contents at more than 4,000 lb. weight of<br>
gold, that is to say, nearly L200,000.<br>
<br>
The chest was securely fastened, and the Captain wrote an address on<br>
the lid, in characters which must have belonged to Modern Greece.<br>
<br>
This done, Captain Nemo pressed a knob, the wire of which communicated<br>
with the quarters of the crew.  Four men appeared, and, not without<br>
some trouble, pushed the chest out of the saloon.  Then I heard them<br>
hoisting it up the iron staircase by means of pulleys.<br>
<br>
At that moment, Captain Nemo turned to me.<br>
<br>
"And you were saying, sir?" said he.<br>
<br>
"I was saying nothing, Captain."<br>
<br>
"Then, sir, if you will allow me, I will wish you good night."<br>
<br>
Whereupon he turned and left the saloon.<br>
<br>
I returned to my room much troubled, as one may believe.  I vainly<br>
tried to sleep--I sought the connecting link between the apparition of<br>
the diver and the chest filled with gold.  Soon, I felt by certain<br>
movements of pitching and tossing that the Nautilus was leaving the<br>
depths and returning to the surface.<br>
<br>
Then I heard steps upon the platform; and I knew they were unfastening<br>
the pinnace and launching it upon the waves.  For one instant it struck<br>
the side of the Nautilus, then all noise ceased.<br>
<br>
Two hours after, the same noise, the same going and coming was renewed;<br>
the boat was hoisted on board, replaced in its socket, and the Nautilus<br>
again plunged under the waves.<br>
<br>
So these millions had been transported to their address.  To what point<br>
of the continent?  Who was Captain Nemo's correspondent?<br>
<br>
The next day I related to Conseil and the Canadian the events of the<br>
night, which had excited my curiosity to the highest degree.  My<br>
companions were not less surprised than myself.<br>
<br>
"But where does he take his millions to?" asked Ned Land.<br>
<br>
To that there was no possible answer.  I returned to the saloon after<br>
having breakfas and set to work.  Till five o'clock in the evening I<br>
employed myself in arranging my notes.  At that moment--(ought I to<br>
attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasy)--I felt so great a heat<br>
that I was obliged to take off my coat.  It was strange, for we were<br>
under low latitudes; and even then the Nautilus, submerged as it was,<br>
ought to experience no change of temperature.  I looked at the<br>
manometer; it showed a depth of sixty feet, to which atmospheric heat<br>
could never attain.<br>
<br>
I continued my work, but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be<br>
intolerable.<br>
<br>
"Could there be fire on board?"  I asked myself.<br>
<br>
I was leaving the saloon, when Captain Nemo entered; he approached the<br>
thermometer, consulted it, and, turning to me, said:<br>
<br>
"Forty-two degrees."<br>
<br>
"I have noticed it, Captain," I replied; "and if it gets much hotter we<br>
cannot bear it."<br>
<br>
"Oh, sir, it will not get better if we do not wish it."<br>
<br>
"You can reduce it as you please, then?"<br>
<br>
"No; but I can go farther from the stove which produces it."<br>
<br>
"It is outward, then!"<br>
<br>
"Certainly; we are floating in a current of boiling water."<br>
<br>
"Is it possible!"  I exclaimed.<br>
<br>
"Look."<br>
<br>
The panels opened, and I saw the sea entirely white all round.  A<br>
sulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves, which boiled like water in<br>
a copper.  I placed my hand on one of the panes of glass, but the heat<br>
was so great that I quickly took it off again.<br>
<br>
"Where are we?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Near the Island of Santorin, sir," replied the Captain.  "I wished to<br>
give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption."<br>
<br>
"I thought," said I, "that the formation of these new islands was<br>
ended."<br>
<br>
"Nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea," replied<br>
Captain Nemo; "and the globe is always being worked by subterranean<br>
fires.  Already, in the nineteenth year of our era, according to<br>
Cassiodorus and Pliny, a new island, Theia (the divine), appeared in<br>
the very place where these islets have recently been formed.  Then they<br>
sank under the waves, to rise again in the year 69, when they again<br>
subsided.  Since that time to our days the Plutonian work has been<br>
suspended.  But on the 3rd of February, 1866, a new island, which they<br>
named George Island, emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour<br>
near Nea Kamenni, and settled again the 6th of the same month.  Seven<br>
days after, the 13th of February, the Island of Aphroessa appeared,<br>
leaving between Nea Kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad.  I was<br>
in these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and I was able therefore to<br>
observe all the different phases.  The Island of Aphroessa, of round<br>
form, measured 300 feet in diameter, and 30 feet in height.  It was<br>
composed of black and vitreous lava, mixed with fragments of felspar.<br>
And lastly, on the 10th of March, a smaller island, called Reka, showed<br>
itself near Nea Kamenni, and since then these three have joined<br>
together, forming but one and the same island."<br>
<br><a href="../site2/page5_4311.html">link2_text</a>
"And the canal in which we are at this moment?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Here it is," replied Captain Nemo, showing me a map of the<br>
Archipelago.  "You see, I have marked the new islands."<br>
<br>
I returned to the glass.  The Nautilus was no longer moving, the heat<br>
was becoming unbearable.  The sea, which till now had been white, was<br>
red, owing to the presence of salts of iron.  In spite of the ship's<br>
being hermetically sealed, an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the<br>
saloon, and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished<br>
by bright scarlet flames.  I was in a bath, I was choking, I was<br>
broiled.<br>
<br>
"We can remain no longer in this boiling water," said I to the Captain.<br>
<br>
"It would not be prudent," replied the impassive Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
An order was given; the Nautilus tacked about and left the furnace it<br>
could not brave with impunity.  A quarter of an hour after we were<br>
breathing fresh air on the surface.  The thought then struck me that,<br>
if Ned Land had chosen this part of the sea for our flight, we should<br>
never have come alive out of this sea of fire.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 16th of February, we left the basin which, between<br>
Rhodes and Alexandria, is reckoned about 1,500 fathoms in depth, and<br>
the Nautilus, passing some distance from Cerigo, quitted the Grecian<br>
Archipelago after having doubled Cape Matapan.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII<br>
<br>
THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS<br>
<br>
The Mediterranean, the blue sea par excellence, "the great sea" of the<br>
Hebrews, "the sea" of the Greeks, the "mare nostrum" of the Romans,<br>
bordered by orange-trees, aloes, cacti, and sea-pines; embalmed with<br>
the perfume of the myrtle, surrounded by rude mountains, saturated with<br>
pure and transparent air, but incessantly worked by underground fires;<br>
a perfect battlefield in which Neptune and Pluto still dispute the<br>
empire of the world!<br>
<br>
It is upon these banks, and on these waters, says Michelet, that man is<br>
renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe.  But,<br>
beautiful as it was, I could only take a rapid glance at the basin<br>
whose superficial area is two million of square yards.  Even Captain<br>
Nemo's knowledge was lost to me, for this puzzling person did not<br>
appear once during our passage at full speed.  I estimated the course<br>
which the Nautilus took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred<br>
leagues, and it was accomplished in forty-eight hours.  Starting on the<br>
morning of the 16th of February from the shores of Greece, we had<br>
crossed the Straits of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.<br>
<br>
It was plain to me that this Mediterranean, enclosed in the midst of<br>
those countries which he wished to avoid, was distasteful to Captain<br>
Nemo.  Those waves and those breezes brought back too many<br>
remembrances, if not too many regrets.  Here he had no longer that<br>
independence and that liberty of gait which he had when in the open<br>
seas, and his Nautilus felt itself cramped between the close shores of<br>
Africa and Europe.<br>
<br>
Our speed was now twenty-five miles an hour.  It may be well understood<br>
that Ned Land, to his great disgust, was obliged to renounce his<br>
intended flight.  He could not launch the pinnace, going at the rate of<br>
twelve or thirteen yards every second.  To quit the Nautilus under such<br>
conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full<br>
speed--an imprudent thing, to say the least of it.  Besides, our vessel<br>
only mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew its stock of<br>
air; it was steered entirely by the compass and the log.<br>
<br>
I saw no more of the interior of this Mediterranean than a traveller by<br>
express train perceives of the landscape which flies before his eyes;<br>
that is to say, the distant horizon, and not the nearer objects which<br>
pass like a flash of lightning.<br>
<br>
We were then passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunis.  In the<br>
narrow space between Cape Bon and the Straits of Messina the bottom of<br>
the sea rose almost suddenly.  There was a perfect bank, on which there<br>
was not more than nine fathoms of water, whilst on either side the<br>
depth was ninety fathoms.<br>
<br>
The Nautilus had to manoeuvre very carefully so as not to strike<br>
against this submarine barrier.<br>
<br>
I showed Conseil, on the map of the Mediterranean, the spot occupied by<br>
this reef.<br>
<br>
"But if you please, sir," observed Conseil, "it is like a real isthmus<br>
joining Europe to Africa."<br>
<br>
"Yes, my boy, it forms a perfect bar to the Straits of Lybia, and the<br>
soundings of Smith have proved that in former tmes the continents<br>
between Cape Boco and Cape Furina were joined."<br>
<br>
"I can well believe it," said Conseil.<br>
<br>
"I will add," I continued, "that a similar barrier exists between<br>
Gibraltar and Ceuta, which in geological times formed the entire<br>
Mediterranean."<br>
<br>
"What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers<br>
above the waves?"<br>
<br>
"It is not probable, Conseil."<br>
<br>
"Well, but allow me to finish, please, sir; if this phenomenon should<br>
take place, it will be troublesome for M. Lesseps, who has taken so<br>
much pains to pierce the isthmus."<br>
<br>
"I agree with you; but I repeat, Conseil, this phenomenon will never<br>
happen.  The violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing.<br>
Volcanoes, so plentiful in the first days of the world, are being<br>
extinguished by degrees; the internal heat is weakened, the temperature<br>
of the lower strata of the globe is lowered by a perceptible quantity<br>
every century to the detriment of our globe, for its heat is its life."<br>
<br>
"But the sun?"<br>
<br>
"The sun is not sufficient, Conseil.  Can it give heat to a dead body?"<br><a href="../site2/page3_4537.html">link3_text</a>
<br>
"Not that I know of."<br>
<br>
"Well, my friend, this earth will one day be that cold corpse; it will<br>
become uninhabitable and uninhabited like the moon, which has long<br>
since lost all its vital heat."<br>
<br>
"In how many centuries?"<br>
<br>
"In some hundreds of thousands of years, my boy."<br>
<br>
"Then," said Conseil, "we shall have time to finish our journey--that<br>
is, if Ned Land does not interfere with it."<br>
<br>
And Conseil, reassured, returned to the study of the bank, which the<br>
Nautilus was skirting at a moderate speed.<br>
<br>
During the night of the 16th and 17th February we had entered the<br>
second Mediterranean basin, the greatest depth of which was 1,450<br>
fathoms.  The Nautilus, by the action of its crew, slid down the<br>
inclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea.<br>
<br>
On the 18th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, we were at<br>
the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar.  There once existed two<br>
currents: an upper one, long since recognised, which conveys the waters<br>
of the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; and a lower<br>
counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist.  Indeed, the<br>
volume of water in the Mediterranean, incessantly added to by the waves<br>
of the Atlantic and by rivers falling into it, would each year raise<br>
the level of this sea, for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore<br>
the equilibrium.  As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the<br>
existence of an under-current, which empties into the basin of the<br>
Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar the surplus waters of the<br>
Mediterranean.  A fact indeed; and it was this counter-current by which<br>
the Nautilus profited.  It advanced rapidly by the narrow pass.  For<br>
one instant I caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of<br>
Hercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low<br>
island which supports it; and a few minutes later we were floating on<br>
the Atlantic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VIII<br>
<br>
VIGO BAY<br>
<br>
The Atlantic! a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers<br>
twenty-five millions of square miles, the length of which is nine<br>
thousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred--an<br>
ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference,<br>
watered by the largest rivers of the world, the St. Lawrence, the<br>
Mississippi, the Amazon, the Plata, the Orinoco, the Niger, the<br>
Senegal, the Elbe, the Loire, and the Rhine, which carry water from the<br>
most civilised, as well as from the most savage, countries!<br>
Magnificent field of water, incessantly ploughed by vessels of every<br>
nation, sheltered by the flags of every nation, and which terminates in<br>
those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners, Cape Horn and the<br>
Cape of Tempests.<br>
<br>
The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having<br>
accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a<br>
distance greater than the great circle of the earth.  Where were we<br>
going now, and what was reserved for the future?  The Nautilus, leaving<br>
the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone far out.  It returned to the surface<br>
of the waves, and our daily walks on the platform were restored to us.<br>
<br>
I mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil.  At a distance<br>
of about twelve miles, Cape St. Vincent was dimly to be seen, forming<br>
the south-western point of the Spanish peninsula.  A strong southerly<br>
gale was blowing.  The sea was swollen and billowy; it made the<br>
Nautilus rock violently.  It was almost impossible to keep one's foot<br>
on the platform, which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every<br>
instant.  So we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air.<br>
<br>
I returned to my room, Conseil to his cabin; but the Canadian, with a<br>
preoccupied air, followed me.  Our rapid passage across the<br>
Mediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution,<br>
and he could not help showing his disappointment.  When the door of my<br>
room was shut, he sat down and looked at me silently.<br>
<br>
"Friend Ned," said I, "I understand you; but you cannot reproach<br>
yourself.  To have attempted to leave the Nautilus under the<br>
circumstances would have been folly."<br>
<br>
Ned Land did not answer; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed<br>
with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind.<br>
<br>
"Let us see," I continued; "we need not despair yet.  We are going up<br>
the coast of Portugal again; France and England are not far off, where<br>
we can easily find refuge.  Now if the Nautilus, on leaving the Straits<br>
of Gibraltar, had gone to the south, if it had carried us towards<br>
regions where there were no continents, I should share your uneasiness.<br>
But we know now that Captain Nemo does not fly from civilised seas, and<br>
in some days I think you can act with security."<br>
<br>
Ned Land still looked at me fixedly; at length his fixed lips parted,<br>
and he said, "It is for to-night."<br>
<br>
I drew myself up suddenly.  I was, I admit, little prepared for this<br>
communication.  I wanted to answer the Canadian, but words would not<br>
come.<br>
<br>
"We agreed to wait for an opportunity," continued Ned Land, "and the<br>
opportunity has arrived.  This night we shall be but a few miles from<br>
the Spanish coast.  It is cloudy.  The wind blows freely.  I have your<br>
word, M. Aronnax, and I rely upon you."<br>
<br>
As I was silent, the Canadian approached me.<br>
<br>
"To-night, at nine o'clock," said he.  "I have warned Conseil.  At that<br>
moment Captain Nemo will be shut up in his room, probably in bed.<br>
Neither the engineers nor the ship's crew can see us.  Conseil and I<br>
will gain the central staircase, and you, M. Aronnax, will remain in<br>
the library, two steps from us, waiting my signal.  The oars, the mast,<br>
and the sail are in the canoe.  I have even succeeded in getting some<br>
provisions.  I have procured an English wrench, to unfasten the bolts<br>
which attach it to the shell of the Nautilus.  So all is ready, till<br>
to-night."<br>
<br><a href="../site2/page8_6097.html">link4_text</a>
"The sea is bad."<br>
<br>
"That I allow," replied the Canadian; "but we must risk that.  Liberty<br>
is worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with<br>
a fair wind to carry us is no great thing.  Who knows but by to-morrow<br>
we may be a hundred leagues away?  Let circumstances only favour us,<br>
and by ten or eleven o'clock we shall have landed on some spot of terra<br>
firma, alive or dead.  But adieu now till to-night."<br>
<br>
With these words the Canadianwithdrew, leaving me almost dumb.  I had<br>
imagined that, the chance gone, I should have time to reflect and<br>
discuss the matter.  My obstinate companion had given me no time; and,<br>
after all, what could I have said to him?  Ned Land was perfectly<br>
right.  There was almost the opportunity to profit by.  Could I retract<br>
my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the<br>
future of my companions?  To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from<br>
all land.<br>
<br>
At that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs<br>
were filling, and that the Nautilus was sinking under the waves of the<br>
Atlantic.<br>
<br>
A sad day I passed, between the desire of regaining my liberty of<br>
action and of abandoning the wonderful Nautilus, and leaving my<br>
submarine studies incomplete.<br>
<br>
What dreadful hours I passed thus!  Sometimes seeing myself and<br>
companions safely landed, sometimes wishing, in spite of my reason,<br>
that some unforeseen circumstance, would prevent the realisation of Ned<br>
Land's project.<br>
<br>
Twice I went to the saloon.  I wished to consult the compass.  I wished<br>
to see if the direction the Nautilus was taking was bringing us nearer<br>
or taking us farther from the coast.  But no; the Nautilus kept in<br>
Portuguese waters.<br>
<br>
I must therefore take my part and prepare for flight.  My luggage was<br>
not heavy; my notes, nothing more.<br>
<br>
As to Captain Nemo, I asked myself what he would think of our escape;<br>
what trouble, what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in<br>
case of its discovery or failure.  Certainly I had no cause to complain<br>
of him; on the contrary, never was hospitality freer than his.  In<br>
leaving him I could not be taxed with ingratitude.  No oath bound us to<br>
him.  It was on the strength of circumstances he relied, and not upon<br>
our word, to fix us for ever.<br>
<br>
I had not seen the Captain since our visit to the Island of Santorin.<br>
Would chance bring me to his presence before our departure?  I wished<br>
it, and I feared it at the same time.  I listened if I could hear him<br>
walking the room contiguous to mine.  No sound reached my ear.  I felt<br>
an unbearable uneasiness.  This day of waiting seemed eternal.  Hours<br>
struck too slowly to keep pace with my impatience.<br>
<br>
My dinner was served in my room as usual.  I ate but little; I was too<br>
preoccupied.  I left the table at seven o'clock. A hundred and twenty<br>
minutes (I counted them) still separated me from the moment in which I<br>
was to join Ned Land.  My agitation redoubled.  My pulse beat<br>
violently.  I could not remain quiet.  I went and came, hoping to calm<br>
my troubled spirit by constant movement.  The idea of failure in our<br>
bold enterprise was the least painful of my anxieties; but the thought<br>
of seeing our project discovered before leaving the Nautilus, of being<br>
brought before Captain Nemo, irritated, or (what was worse) saddened,<br>
at my desertion, made my heart beat.<br>
<br>
I wanted to see the saloon for the last time.  I descended the stairs<br>
and arrived in the museum, where I had passed so many useful and<br>
agreeable hours.  I looked at all its riches, all its treasures, like a<br>
man on the eve of an eternal exile, who was leaving never to return.<br>
<br>
These wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for<br>
so many days my life had been concentrated, I was going to abandon them<br>
for ever!  I should like to have taken a last look through the windows<br>
of the saloon into the waters of the Atlantic:  but the panels were<br>
hermetically closed, and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean<br>
which I had not yet explored.<br>
<br>
In passing through the saloon, I came near the door let into the angle<br>
which opened into the Captain's room.  To my great surprise, this door<br>
was ajar.  I drew back involuntarily.  If Captain Nemo should be in his<br>
room, he could see me.  But, hearing no sound, I drew nearer.  The room<br>
was deserted.  I pushed open the door and took some steps forward.<br>
Still the same monklike severity of aspect.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the clock struck eight.  The first beat of the hammer on the<br>
bell awoke me from my dreams.  I trembled as if an invisible eye had<br>
plunged into my most secret thoughts, and I hurried from the room.<br>
<br>
There my eye fell upon the compass.  Our course was still north.  The<br>
log indicated moderate speed, the manometer a depth of about sixty feet.<br>
<br>
I returned to my room, clothed myself warmly--sea boots, an otterskin<br>
cap, a great coat of byssus, lined with sealskin; I was ready, I was<br>
waiting.  The vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which<br>
reigned on board.  I listened attentively.  Would no loud voice<br>
suddenly inform me that Ned Land had been surprised in his projected<br>
flight.  A mortal dread hung over me, and I vainly tried to regain my<br>
accustomed coolness.<br>
<br>
At a few minutes to nine, I put my ear to the Captain's door.  No<br>
noise.  I left my room and returned to the saloon, which was half in<br>
obscurity, but deserted.<br>
<br>
I opened the door communicating with the library.  The same<br>
insufficient light, the same solitude.  I placed myself near the door<br>
leading to the central staircase, and there waited for Ned Land's<br>
signal.<br>
<br>
At that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished, then it<br>
stopped entirely.  The silence was now only disturbed by the beatings<br>
of my own heart.  Suddenly a slight shock was felt; and I knew that the<br>
Nautilus had stopped at the bottom of the ocean.  My uneasiness<br>
increased.  The Canadian's signal did not come.  I felt inclined to<br>
join Ned Land and beg of him to put off his attempt.  I felt that we<br>
were not sailing under our usual conditions.<br>
<br>
At this moment the door of the large saloon opened, and Captain Nemo<br>
appeared.  He saw me, and without further preamble began in an amiable<br>
tone of voice:<br><a href="../site2/page0_6685.html">link5_text</a>
<br>
"Ah, sir!  I have been looking for you.  Do you know the history of<br>
Spain?"<br>
<br>
Now, one might know the history of one's own country by heart; but in<br>
the condition I was at the time, with troubled mind and head quite<br>
lost, I could not have said a word of it.<br>
<br>
"Well," continued Captain Nemo, "you heard my question!  Do you know<br>
the history of Spain?"<br>
<br>
"Very slightly," I answered.<br>
<br>
"Well, here are learned men having to learn," said the Captain.  "Come,<br>
sit down, and I will tell you a curious episode in this history.  Sir,<br>
listen well," said he; "this history will interest you on one side, for<br>
it will answer a question which doubtless you have not been able to<br>
solve."<br>
<br>
"I listen, Captain," said I, not knowing what my interlocutor was<br>
driving at, and asking myself if this incident was bearing on our<br>
projected flight.<br>
<br>
"Sir, if you have no objection, we will go back to 1702.  You cannot be<br>
ignorant that your king, Louis XIV, thinking that the gesture of a<br>
potentate was sufficient to bring the Pyrenees under his yoke, had<br>
imposed the Duke of Anjou, his grandson, on the Spaniards.  This prince<br>
reigned more or less badly under the name of Philip V, and had a strong<br>
party against him abroad.  Indeed, the preceding year, the royal houses<br>
of Holland, Austria, and England had concluded a treaty of alliance at<br>
the Hague, with the intention of plucking the crown of Spain from the<br>
head of Philip V, and placing it on that of an archduke to whom they<br>
prematurely gave the title of Charles III.<br>
<br>
"Spain must resist this coalition; but she was almost entirely<br>
unprovided with either soldiers or sailors.  However, money would not<br>
fail them, provided that their galleons, laden with gold and silver<br>
from America, once enterd their ports.  And about the end of 1702 they<br>
expected a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet of<br>
twenty-three vessels, commanded by Admiral Chateau-Renaud, for the<br>
ships of the coalition were already beating the Atlantic.  This convoy<br>
was to go to Cadiz, but the Admiral, hearing that an English fleet was<br>
cruising in those waters, resolved to make for a French port.<br>
<br>
"The Spanish commanders of the convoy objected to this decision.  They<br>
wanted to be taken to a Spanish port, and, if not to Cadiz, into Vigo<br>
Bay, situated on the northwest coast of Spain, and which was not<br>
blocked.<br>
<br>
"Admiral Chateau-Renaud had the rashness to obey this injunction, and<br>
the galleons entered Vigo Bay.<br>
<br>
"Unfortunately, it formed an open road which could not be defended in<br>
any way.  They must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the<br>
arrival of the combined fleet; and time would not have failed them had<br>
not a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen.<br>
<br>
"You are following the chain of events?" asked Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
"Perfectly," said I, not knowing the end proposed by this historical<br>
lesson.<br>
<br>
"I will continue.  This is what passed.  The merchants of Cadiz had a<br>
privilege by which they had the right of receiving all merchandise<br>
coming from the West Indies.  Now, to disembark these ingots at the<br>
port of Vigo was depriving them of their rights.  They complained at<br>
Madrid, and obtained the consent of the weak-minded Philip that the<br>
convoy, without discharging its cargo, should remain sequestered in the<br>
roads of Vigo until the enemy had disappeared.<br>
<br>
"But whilst coming to this decision, on the 22nd of October, 1702, the<br>
English vessels arrived in Vigo Bay, when Admiral Chateau-Renaud, in<br>
spite of inferior forces, fought bravely.  But, seeing that the<br>
treasure must fall into the enemy's hands, he burnt and scuttled every<br>
galleon, which went to the bottom with their immense riches."<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo stopped.  I admit I could not see yet why this history<br>
should interest me.<br>
<br>
"Well?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"Well, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, "we are in that Vigo Bay; and<br>
it rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries."<br>
<br>
The Captain rose, telling me to follow him.  I had had time to recover.<br>
I obeyed.  The saloon was dark, but through the transparent glass the<br>
waves were sparkling.  I looked.<br>
<br>
For half a mile around the Nautilus, the waters seemed bathed in<br>
electric light.  The sandy bottom was clean and bright.  Some of the<br>
ship's crew in their diving-dresses were clearing away half-rotten<br>
barrels and empty cases from the midst of the blackened wrecks.  From<br>
these cases and from these barrels escaped ingots of gold and silver,<br>
cascades of piastres and jewels.  The sand was heaped up with them.<br>
Laden with their precious booty, the men returned to the Nautilus,<br>
disposed of their burden, and went back to this inexhaustible fishery<br>
of gold and silver.<br>
<br>
I understood now.  This was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of<br>
October, 1702.  Here on this very spot the galleons laden for the<br>
Spanish Government had sunk.  Here Captain Nemo came, according to his<br>
wants, to pack up those millions with which he burdened the Nautilus.<br>
It was for him and him alone America had given up her precious metals.<br>
He was heir direct, without anyone to share, in those treasures torn<br>
from the Incas and from the conquered of Ferdinand Cortez.<br>
<br>
"Did you know, sir," he asked, smiling, "that the sea contained such<br>
riches?"<br>
<br>
"I knew," I answered, "that they value money held in suspension in<br>
these waters at two millions."<br>
<br>
"Doubtless; but to extract this money the expense would be greater than<br>
the profit.  Here, on the contrary, I have but to pick up what man has<br>
lost--and not only in Vigo Bay, but in a thousand other ports where<br>
shipwrecks have happened, and which are marked on my submarine map.<br>
Can you understand now the source of the millions I am worth?"<br>
<br>
"I understand, Captain.  But allow me to tell you that in exploring<br><a href="../site7/page7_8998.html">link6_text</a>
Vigo Bay you have only been beforehand with a rival society."<br>
<br>
"And which?"<br>
<br>
"A society which has received from the Spanish Government the privilege<br>
of seeking those buried galleons.  The shareholders are led on by the<br>
allurement of an enormous bounty, for they value these rich shipwrecks<br>
at five hundred millions."<br>
<br>
"Five hundred millions they were," answered Captain Nemo, "but they are<br>
so no longer."<br>
<br>
"Just so," said I; "and a warning to those shareholders would be an act<br>
of charity.  But who knows if it would be well received?  What gamblers<br>
usually regret above all is less the loss of their money than of their<br>
foolish hopes.  After all, I pity them less than the thousands of<br>
unfortunates to whom so much riches well-distributed would have been<br>
profitable, whilst for them they will be for ever barren."<br>
<br>
I had no sooner expressed this regret than I felt that it must have<br>
wounded Captain Nemo.<br>
<br>
"Barren!" he exclaimed, with animation.  "Do you think then, sir, that<br>
these riches are lost because I gather them?  Is it for myself alone,<br>
according to your idea, that I take the trouble to collect these<br>
treasures?  Who told you that I did not make a good use of it?  Do you<br>
think I am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races<br>
on this earth, miserable creatures to console, victims to avenge?  Do<br>
you not understand?"<br>
<br>
Captain Nemo stopped at these last words, regretting perhaps that he<br>
had spoken so much.  But I had guessed that, whatever the motive which<br>
had forced him to seek independence under the sea, it had left him<br>
still a man, that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity,<br>
and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as<br>
individuals.  And I then understood for whom those millions were<br>
destined which were forwarded by Captain Nemo when the Nautilus was<br>
cruising in the waters of Crete.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX<br>
<br>
A VANISHED CONTINENT<br>
<br>
The next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my<br>
room.  I expected this visit.  He looked very disappointed.<br>
<br>
"Well, sir?" said he.<br>
<br>
"Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday."<br>
<br>
"Yes; that Captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended<br>
leaving his vessel."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Ned, he had business at his bankers."<br>
<br>
"His bankers!"<br>
<br>
"Or rather his banking-house; by that I mean the ocean, where his<br>
riches are safer than in the chests of the State."<br>
<br>
I then related to the Canadian the incidents of the preceding night,<br>
hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but<br>
my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret<br>
from Ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of<br>
Vigo on his own account.<br>
<br>
"However," said he, "all is not ended.  It is only a blow of the<br>
harpoon lost.  Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if<br>
necessary----"<br>
<br>
"In what direction is the Nautilus going?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"I do not know," replied Ned.<br>
<br>
"Well, at noon we shall see the point."<br>
<br>
The Canadian returned to Conseil.  As soon as I was dressed, I went<br>
into the saloon.  The compass was not reassuring.  The course of the<br>
Nautilus was S.S.W. We were turning our backs on Europe.<br>
<br>
I waited with some impatience till the ship's place was pricked on the<br>
chart.  At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and our<br>
vessel rose to the surface of the ocean.  I rushed towards the<br>
platfom.  Ned Land had preceded me.  No more land in sight.  Nothing<br>
but an immense sea.  Some sails on the horizon, doubtless those going<br>
to San Roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of<br>
Good Hope.  The weather was cloudy.  A gale of wind was preparing.  Ned<br>
raved, and tried to pierce the cloudy horizon.  He still hoped that<br>
behind all that fog stretched the land he so longed for.<br>
<br>
At noon the sun showed itself for an instant.  The second profited by<br>
this brightness to take its height.  Then, the sea becoming more<br>
billowy, we descended, and the panel closed.<br>
<br>
An hour after, upon consulting the chart, I saw the position of the<br>
Nautilus was marked at 16° 17' long., and 33° 22' lat., at 150<br>
leagues from the nearest coast.  There was no means of flight, and I<br>
leave you to imagine the rage of the Canadian when I informed him of<br>
our situation.<br>
<br>
For myself, I was not particularly sorry.  I felt lightened of the load<br>
which had oppressed me, and was able to return with some degree of<br>
calmness to my accustomed work.<br>
<br>
That night, about eleven o'clock, I received a most unexpected visit<br>
from Captain Nemo.  He asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from<br>
my watch of the preceding night.  I answered in the negative.<br>
<br>
"Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion."<br>
<br>
"Propose, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"You have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight, under<br>
the brightness of the sun.  Would it suit you to see them in the<br>
darkness of the night?"<br>
<br>
"Most willingly."<br><a href="../site4/page9_2398.html">link7_text</a>
<br>
"I warn you, the way will be tiring.  We shall have far to walk, and<br>
must climb a mountain.  The roads are not well kept."<br>
<br>
"What you say, Captain, only heightens my curiosity; I am ready to<br>
follow you."<br>
<br>
"Come then, sir, we will put on our diving-dresses."<br>
<br>
Arrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any<br>
of the ship's crew were to follow us on this excursion.  Captain Nemo<br>
had not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil.<br>
<br>
In a few moments we had put on our diving-dresses; they placed on our<br>
backs the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps<br>
were prepared.  I called the Captain's attention to the fact.<br>
<br>
"They will be useless," he replied.<br>
<br>
I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my<br>
observation, for the Captain's head had already disappeared in its<br>
metal case.  I finished harnessing myself.  I felt them put an<br>
iron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going<br>
through the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a<br>
depth of 150 fathoms.  Midnight was near.  The waters were profoundly<br>
dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a<br>
sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the<br>
Nautilus.  What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it<br>
lit up the liquid mass, I could not say.  In any case, it did light our<br>
way, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar<br>
darkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness<br>
of the Ruhmkorff apparatus.<br>
<br>
As we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head.  The noise<br>
redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood<br>
the cause.  It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of<br>
the waves.  Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I<br>
should be wet through!  By the water! in the midst of the water!  I<br>
could not help laughing at the odd idea.  But, indeed, in the thick<br>
diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems<br>
to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere.<br>
Nothing more.<br>
<br>
After half an hour's walk the soil became stony.  Medusae, microscopic<br>
crustacea, and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent<br>
gleam.  I caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of<br>
zoophytes and masses of sea weed.  My feet often slipped upon this<br>
sticky carpet of sea weed, and without my iron-tipped stick I should<br>
have fallen more than once.  In turning round, I could still see the<br>
whitish lantern of the Nautilus beginning to pale in the distance.<br>
<br>
But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon.<br>
The presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree.<br>
Was I going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the _savants_<br>
of the earth?  Or even (for this thought crossed my brain) had the hand<br>
of man aught to do with this conflagration?  Had he fanned this flame?<br>
Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of Captain Nemo<br>
whom he was going to visit, and who, like him, led this strange<br>
existence?  Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who,<br>
weary of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence<br>
in the deep ocean?  All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued<br>
me.  And in this condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of<br>
wonders continually passing before my eyes, I should not have been<br>
surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns<br>
of which Captain Nemo dreamed.<br>
<br>
Our road grew lighter and lighter.  The white glimmer came in rays from<br>
the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high.  But what I saw was<br>
simply a reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters.  The<br>
source of this inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of<br>
the mountain.<br>
<br>
In the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic,<br>
Captain Nemo advanced without hesitation.  He knew this dreary road.<br>
Doubtless he had often travelled over it, and could not lose himself.<br>
I followed him with unshaken confidence.  He seemed to me like a genie<br>
of the sea; and, as he walked before me, I could not help admiring his<br>
stature, which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon.<br>
<br>
It was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the<br>
mountain; but to gain access to them we must venture through the<br>
difficult paths of a vast copse.<br>
<br>
Yes; a copse of dead trees, without leaves, without sap, trees<br>
petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by<br>
gigantic pines.  It was like a coal-pit still standing, holding by the<br>
roots to the broken soil, and whose branches, like fine black paper<br>
cuttings, showed distinctly on the watery ceiling.  Picture to yourself<br>
a forest in the Hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain, but a<br>
forest swallowed up.  The paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus,<br>
between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea.  I went along,<br>
climbing the rocks, striding over extended trunks, breaking the sea<br>
bind-weed which hung from one tree to the other; and frightening the<br>
fishes, which flew from branch to branch.  Pressing onward, I felt no<br>
fatigue.  I followed my guide, who was never tired.  What a spectacle!<br>
How can I express it? how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in<br>
this medium--their under parts dark and wild, the upper coloured with<br>
red tints, by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters<br>
doubled?  We climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic<br>
bounds and the low growling of an avalanche.  To right and left ran<br>
long, dark galleries, where sight was lost.  Here opened vast glades<br>
which the hand of man seemed to have worked; and I sometimes asked<br>
myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly<br>
appear to me.<br>
<br>
But Captain Nemo was still mounting.  I could not stay behind.  I<br>
followed boldly.  My stick gave me good help.  A false step woud have<br>
been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the<br>
gulfs; but I walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness.  Now<br>
I jumped a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had<br>
it been among the glaciers on the land; now I ventured on the unsteady<br>
trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without<br>
looking under my feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of<br>
this region.<br>
<br>
There, monumental rocks, leaning on their regularly-cut bases, seemed<br>
to defy all laws of equilibrium.  From between their stony knees trees<br>
sprang, like a jet under heavy pressure, and upheld others which upheld<br>
them.  Natural towers, large scarps, cut perpendicularly, like a<br><a href="../site6/page2_4544.html">link8_text</a>
"curtain," inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could<br>
never have tolerated in terrestrial regions.<br>
<br>
Two hours after quitting the Nautilus we had crossed the line of trees,<br>
and a hundred feet above our heads rose the top of the mountain, which<br>
cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope.  Some<br>
petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there.  Fishes got up under<br>
our feet like birds in the long grass.  The massive rocks were rent<br>
with impenetrable fractures, deep grottos, and unfathomable holes, at<br>
the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving.  My<br>
blood curdled when I saw enormous antennae blocking my road, or some<br>
frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity.<br>
Millions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness.<br>
They were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their holes; giant<br>
lobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers, and moving their claws<br>
with the clicking sound of pincers; titanic crabs, pointed like a gun<br>
on its carriage; and frightful-looking poulps, interweaving their<br>
tentacles like a living nest of serpents.<br>
<br>
We had now arrived on the first platform, where other surprises awaited<br>
me.  Before us lay some picturesque ruins, which betrayed the hand of<br>
man and not that of the Creator.  There were vast heaps of stone,<br>
amongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles<br>
and temples, clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes, and over<br>
which, instead of ivy, sea-weed and fucus threw a thick vegetable<br>
mantle.  But what was this portion of the globe which had been<br>
swallowed by cataclysms?  Who had placed those rocks and stones like<br>
cromlechs of prehistoric times?  Where was I?  Whither had Captain<br>
Nemo's fancy hurried me?<br>
<br>
I would fain have asked him; not being able to, I stopped him--I seized<br>
his arm.  But, shaking his head, and pointing to the highest point of<br>
the mountain, he seemed to say:<br>
<br>
"Come, come along; come higher!"<br>
<br>
I followed, and in a few minutes I had climbed to the top, which for a<br>
circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock.<br>
<br>
I looked down the side we had just climbed.  The mountain did not rise<br>
more than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain; but<br>
on the opposite side it commanded from twice that height the depths of<br>
this part of the Atlantic.  My eyes ranged far over a large space lit<br>
by a violent fulguration.  In fact, the mountain was a volcano.<br>
<br>
At fifty feet above the peak, in the midst of a rain of stones and<br>
scoriae, a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell<br>
in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass.  Thus situated,<br>
this volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch, even to the<br>
extreme limits of the horizon.  I said that the submarine crater threw<br>
up lava, but no flames.  Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed<br>
upon and cannot be developed under water; but streams of lava, having<br>
in themselves the principles of their incandescence, can attain a white<br>
heat, fight vigorously against the liquid element, and turn it to<br>
vapour by contact.<br>
<br>
Rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of<br>
lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on<br>
another Terra del Greco.<br>
<br>
There indeed under my eyes, ruined, destroyed, lay a town--its roofs<br>
open to the sky, its temples fallen, its arches dislocated, its columns<br>
lying on the ground, from which one would still recognise the massive<br>
character of Tuscan architecture.  Further on, some remains of a<br>
gigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the<br>
floating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if an<br>
ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and<br>
disappeared with its merchant vessels and its war-galleys. Farther on<br>
again, long lines of sunken walls and broad, deserted streets--a<br>
perfect Pompeii escaped beneath the waters.  Such was the sight that<br>
Captain Nemo brought before my eyes!<br>
<br>
Where was I?  Where was I?  I must know at any cost.  I tried to speak,<br>
but Captain Nemo stopped me by a gesture, and, picking up a piece of<br>
chalk-stone, advanced to a rock of black basalt, and traced the one<br>
word:<br>
<br>
<br>
ATLANTIS<br>
<br>
<br>
What a light shot through my mind!  Atlantis! the Atlantis of Plato,<br>
that continent denied by Origen and Humbolt, who placed its<br>
disappearance amongst the legendary tales.  I had it there now before<br>
my eyes, bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its<br>
catastrophe.  The region thus engulfed was beyond Europe, Asia, and<br>
Lybia, beyond the columns of Hercules, where those powerful people, the<br>
Atlantides, lived, against whom the first wars of ancient Greeks were<br>
waged.<br>
<br>
Thus, led by the strangest destiny, I was treading under foot the<br>
mountains of this continent, touching with my hand those ruins a<br>
thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs.<br>
I was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first<br>
man had walked.<br>
<br>
Whilst I was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand<br>
landscape, Captain Nemo remained motionless, as if petrified in mute<br>
ecstasy, leaning on a mossy stone.  Was he dreaming of those<br>
generations long since disappeared?  Was he asking them the secret of<br>
human destiny?  Was it here this strange man came to steep himself in<br>
historical recollections, and live again this ancient life--he who<br>
wanted no modern one?  What would I not have given to know his<br>
thoughts, to share them, to understand them!  We remained for an hour<br>
at this place, contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of<br>
the lava, which was some times wonderfully intense.  Rapid tremblings<br>
ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings, deep noise,<br>
distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with<br>
majestic grandeur.  At this moment the moon appeared through the mass<br>
of waters and threw her pale rays on the buried continent.  It was but<br>
a gleam, but what an indescribable effect!  The Captain rose, cast one<br>
last look on the immense plain, and then bade me follow him.<br>
<br>
We descended the mountain rapidly, and, the mineral forest once passed,<br>
I saw the lantern of the Nautilus shining like a star.  The Captain<br>
walked straight to it, and we got on board as the first rays of light<br>
whitened the surface of the ocean.<br>

CHAPTER X<br>
<br>
THE SUBMARINE COAL-MINES<br>
<br>
The next day, the 20th of February, I awoke very late:  the fatigues of<br>
the previous night had prolonged my sleep until eleven o'clock. I<br>
dressed quickly, and hastened to find the course the Nautilus was<br>
taking.  The instruments showed it to be still toward the south, with a<br>
speed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathms.<br>
<br>
The species of fishes here did not differ much from those already<br>
noticed.  There were rays of giant size, five yards long, and endowed<br>
with great muscular strength, which enabled them to shoot above the<br>
waves; sharks of many kinds; amongst others, one fifteen feet long,<br>
with triangular sharp teeth, and whose transparency rendered it almost<br>
invisible in the water.<br>
<br>
Amongst bony fish Conseil noticed some about three yards long, armed at<br>
the upper jaw with a piercing sword; other bright-coloured creatures,<br>
known in the time of Aristotle by the name of the sea-dragon, which are<br>
dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back.<br>
<br>
About four o'clock, the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed<br>
with petrified wood, changed by degrees, and it became more stony, and<br>
seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt, with a sprinkling<br>
of lava.  I thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long<br>
plains; and accordingly, after a few evolutions of the Nautilus, I saw<br>
the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close all<br>
exit.  Its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean.  It must be<br>
a continent, or at least an island--one of the Canaries, or of the Cape<br>
Verde Islands.  The bearings not being yet taken, perhaps designedly, I<br>
was ignorant of our exact position.  In any case, such a wall seemed to<br>
me to mark the limits of that Atlantis, of which we had in reality<br>
passed over only the smallest part.<br>
<br>
Much longer should I have remained at the window admiring the beauties<br>
of sea and sky, but the panels closed.  At this moment the Nautilus<br>
arrived at the side of this high, perpendicular wall.  What it would<br>
do, I could not guess.  I returned to my room; it no longer moved.  I<br>
laid myself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours'<br>
sleep; but it was eight o'clock the next day when I entered the saloon.<br>
I looked at the manometer.  It told me that the Nautilus was floating<br>
on the surface of the ocean.  Besides, I heard steps on the platform.<br>
I went to the panel.  It was open; but, instead of broad daylight, as I<br>
expected, I was surrounded by profound darkness.  Where were we?  Was I<br>
mistaken?  Was it still night?  No; not a star was shining and night<br>
has not that utter darkness.<br>
<br>
I knew not what to think, when a voice near me said:<br>
<br>
"Is that you, Professor?"<br>
<br>
"Ah!  Captain," I answered, "where are we?"<br>
<br>
"Underground, sir."<br>
<br>
"Underground!"  I exclaimed.  "And the Nautilus floating still?"<br>
<br>
"It always floats."<br>
<br>
"But I do not understand."<br>
<br>
"Wait a few minutes, our lantern will be lit, and, if you like light<br>
places, you will be satisfied."<br>
<br>
I stood on the platform and waited.  The darkness was so complete that<br>
I could not even see Captain Nemo; but, looking to the zenith, exactly<br>
above my head, I seemed to catch an undecided gleam, a kind of twilight<br>
filling a circular hole.  At this instant the lantern was lit, and its<br>
vividness dispelled the faint light.  I closed my dazzled eyes for an<br>
instant, and then looked again.  The Nautilus was stationary, floating<br>
near a mountain which formed a sort of quay.  The lake, then,<br>
supporting it was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls, measuring two<br>
miles in diameter and six in circumference.  Its level (the manometer<br>
showed) could only be the same as the outside level, for there must<br>
necessarily be a communication between the lake and the sea.  The high<br>
partitions, leaning forward on their base, grew into a vaulted roof<br>
bearing the shape of an immense funnel turned upside down, the height<br>
being about five or six hundred yards.  At the summit was a circular<br>
orifice, by which I had caught the slight gleam of light, evidently<br>
daylight.<br>
<br>
"Where are we?"  I asked.<br>
<br>
"In the very heart of an extinct volcano, the interior of which has<br>
been invaded by the sea, after some great convulsion of the earth.<br>
Whilst you were sleeping, Professor, the Nautilus penetrated to this<br>
lagoon by a natural canal, which opens about ten yards beneath the<br>
surface of the ocean.  This is its harbour of refuge, a sure,<br>
commodious, and mysterious one, sheltered from all gales.  Show me, if<br>
you can, on the coasts of any of your continents or islands, a road<br>
which can give such perfect refuge from all storms."<br>
<br>
"Certainly," I replied, "you are in safety here, Captain Nemo.  Who<br>
could reach you in the heart of a volcano?  But did I not see an<br>
opening at its summit?"<br>
<br>
"Yes; its crater, formerly filled with lava, vapour, and flames, and<br>
which now gives entrance to the life-giving air we breathe."<br>
<br>
"But what is this volcanic mountain?"<br>
<br>
"It belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is<br>
strewn--to vessels a simple sandbank--to us an immense cavern.  Chance<br>
led me to discover it, and chance served me well."<br>
<br>
"But of what use is this refuge, Captain?  The Nautilus wants no port."<br>
<br>
"No, sir; but it wants electricity to make it move, and the wherewithal<br>
to make the electricity--sodium to feed the elements, coal from which<br>
to get the sodium, and a coal-mine to supply the coal.  And exactly on<br>
this spot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological<br>
periods, now mineralised and transformed into coal; for me they are an<br>
inexhaustible mine."<br>
<br>
"Your men follow the trade of miners here, then, Captain?"<br>
<br>
"Exactly so.  These mines extend under the waves like the mines of<br><a href="../site9/page8_3018.html">link10_text</a>
